Students sing the lead role at the zhejiang university academic annual conference The research results make people's minds open - Xinhua Net
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with a breath, and accurately search for the source of smog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, the research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students from a curious idea, created a lot of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smart phone side, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a light breath, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of your body from the gas components you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, which targets chemical elements and a keen sense of smell that allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: High-energy eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lamp used in the doctor's operating room. ”
Shen Junfei said that for example, in the early examination of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp plates that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and imagelessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just by standing on the handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air, which forms a fluid at the tap, is combined with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands! ”
Color development reactions and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Challenges Summit, the invention stood out from many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

South African doctor: Although the transmissibility of Aomi Kerong is strong, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omilton variant is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
As the Aumechjong variant spreads in South Africa, an organization of more than five thousand doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of covid-19 patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs, similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none need to be hospitalized yet.
Pillay said: "They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation . ”
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, which would otherwise be more likely to be severely ill from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omiljung mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, which is half the proportion of severe diseases in the previous wave; The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared with 20% of deaths in early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cites data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease . ”
He also said: "It's still early, and we need to get the data later.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we enter this wave of outbreaks for only two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of COVID-19, cases of Omiljung are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng in the first week of December increased by 400 percent, and tests showed that the Omiljung variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy to the famous public service slogan "No sale, no killing", then, in a good environment without the demand for "abduction", mass prevention and mass governance and the whole people's anti-abduction make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Abduction Office.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I feel warm and warm.
The new technology means are not only called "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also use information properly, practically and effectively.
The primary goal of cracking down on abduction and law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, until the abduction and trafficking case is broken, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help", topics such as "whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be executed all the time" can be put aside and discussed cautiously; But the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they have succeeded.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform that directly help to solve the case and find the child.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
Cracking down on crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulousness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, and the parents were asleep, and they woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Two parents taking turns resting, or keeping their children under safe protection, are the minimum means of preventing children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police crackdown on trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single wrongdoer is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Provisions of our Criminal Code, the statutory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the confiscation of property shall be imposed.
With a high starting point and a maximum punishment, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishments under the general trend of "light punishment".
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have a weak sense of law.
The legal education of this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction and trafficking exists extensively, and the traffickers are eager for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a "fighting method" situation with law enforcers, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and bribery of children.

The democracy summit came to an end, and Biden said the flame of freedom would never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world and leaders of civil society and the private sector, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Guan-chung, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because I have said before that, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the faint fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. ”
Speaking to the summit via pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Guancong reminded participants of their continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among Ethnic Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has been subject to China's rise without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. ”
Mr. Law also called on the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
"Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change . ”
Tang Feng, a political councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "National Declaration" via video during a roundtable discussion on "Cracking Down on Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in how to combat COVID-19 through transparency and building trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in its infancy, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy is showing signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the shelves to defeat false information. ”
At the same time as the second day of the Democracy Summit, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which have been found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance techniques to assist in human rights violations.

The girl collects donations for her sister as an arrow target: "It's okay to think that it is a flesh and skin injury" - Xinhua Net
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girls willing to be 'arrow targets' to raise donations for her sister" burst the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, and the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after payment.
This behavior has aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move to collect donations for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating, and after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls were warned of "arrow target" fundraising on the street
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "one", and the wooden board is written with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" in black ink, and the other wooden board in front of her is written with her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay account number, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging behavior of bo eyeballs", and many netizens express sympathy for this.
"We found out when we patrolled to the side of the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers at that time. ”
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who does the "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl was on the side to help shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery, please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was collecting donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still requires more than 300,000 costs, it is impossible to think of a good way to raise donations, so this behavior has been made.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target, and one was responsible for laying hands, but they did not participate in it, and no one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone watched and took a photo and posted it on Weibo.
Later, the police were identified by the Public Security Department as using bows and arrows that were not regulated.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eyeball fundraising method is not recommended."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observation Network - professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival national network payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, compared with previous years to a new high.
A variety of full reduction red envelopes, eye-catching live streaming with goods once again let consumers shout for benefit, this consumption boom on the one hand makes people lament that the national consumption power is getting stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, China's residents have a better performance at the level of financial consumption, but they reflect great differences in different financial behaviors and skills, and they need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen released the "China Youth Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance released the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" shows that the young generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive squandering" label labeled by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend consumption behavior. And thus generated excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility, positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct concept of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumer needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay the loan on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life of buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner for consumers.
Vietnam People's Daily - GCC addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a sweeping embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by both countries.
The Gulf Arab States resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of a demand that must be united for the interests of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate mobility and integrated supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — an agreement condemned by gulf Arab states for arguing that they could not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that there is a flaw in not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has negotiated directly with Iran against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers to meet the wishes of the Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since some members ended their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits accumulated by a university in the process of development for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological, social development, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's universities, arising in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply affected by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde Ji Shi, Xiu Qi Zhi Ping" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating the country with learning".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent competition is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Comprehensively Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's most popular in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking in curves"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; The second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, and carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and enhance image; The third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catch-up and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that the construction of a world-class university cannot be a thousand schools, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running the school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and combines school and enterprise, and forms a whole-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang university-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Moral Cultivation, Discernment and Solidity" and "Haina River, Qizhen Houde, Pioneering People, and Building Our Country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents are used by me", and is expressed as the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Qi Zhen HouDe" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and being kind, which refers to the fact that while pursuing the truth, universities should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the improvement of personality; "Pioneering the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the innovation of knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, but also the reform and development, the revolution of the old and the new; "Building Our Nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication and talks about the fact that universities should always share the glory and disgrace of the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission shouldered by the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation can stir each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Asian American groups complain about admissions discrimination at 3 Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhua Net
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting that three famous Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College —discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian-American Education Coalition, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American universities has doubled, but in these 3 american universities, the proportion of Asians has remained basically at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three colleges and universities, Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
The U.S. Department of Education data also shows that Brown and Dartmouth Have the lowest percentage of Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have imposed de facto racial quotas on Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they hope that after filing the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained colleges and universities to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the 3 universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian American Education Coalition complained about harvard admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the complaint also included Indian American, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
Chinese After the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw a line with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatism and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', resulting in disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long since become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere with other countries.
The summit is Biden's act of delivering on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video and was attended by 111 world leaders, including The leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the grounds that there were problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to preside over such a summit.
There were also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticism that some of the leaders invited to the meeting including some authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubted that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholts also attended the Video Democracy Summit
China's Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is full of pathologies, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social rift, racial contradictions, and the division between the rich and the poor are intensifying."
In his remarks, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the power of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time." "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need to be defended by fighters in the face of ongoing and worrisome challenges."
The U.S. side pledged a year-long initiative after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news outlets.
The United States expects countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the entity democracy summit planned for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all of us deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year."
Educational Thinking: How College Examinations Can Make "Academic Bullies" and "Scum of Learning" Get Their Own Places - Xinhua Net
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and let the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic."
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability, coupled with varying levels of learning.
For the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the test question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not use work may be able to pass the pre-exam concentrated assault, and if they think of other methods, it is possible to achieve the effect of doubling the results with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "scum" who can pass the pass without investing in it, and even get a high score; "Xueba" usually never falls behind, the homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems existing in the university examination are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only the existence of Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these 3 students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, people who have gone to college know very well that it is not uncommon to surprisely prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and seek "key counseling" before the exam, and even the situation of carrying a small copy in the exam and asking the teacher to raise his noble hand after the exam is not a strange thing.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, the measure of whether a university examination is passed or not lies in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to subdivide, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, from the knowledge point, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As some teachers have said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the focus." ”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will coordinate the composition of the examination paper, and the examination paper will also be participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the duplication of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning, the topics are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time innovate the design of the question type.
Examinations are the baton of university education, what kind of examinations, students will have a corresponding preparation plan, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' letter of recommendation, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examinations of course completion examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test questions, repeated questions and other issues is the university examination need to face the topic, of course, the need to introduce the corresponding system, but the kung fu is expensive in daily life, the teacher needs to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, the two ends of the thorough, teaching and learning will be better docked, the formation of benign interaction, the examination will be more realistic, so that the "learning bully" and "scum" each have their place.

He explained that sabah newspaper used different security paper than other regions and therefore could not be borrowed from other states.
Kairouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah and immediately carry out the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will take 2 more working days (December 20) to hand over to the applicants." ”
"We will notify applicants to go to local sub-bureaus to collect the newspaper paper. ”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities - Xinhua Net
Beijing, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring those who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to land border port cities to conduct nucleic acid testing at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones in their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there are frequent exchanges between border people on both sides.
The implementation of the differentiated management policy of zoning, from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, a number of local clusters of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which are imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed the problems of untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places, the closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the sanitize of all links of cold chain goods, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the emergency handling of the epidemic situation is not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made from 9 aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, we will accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of the prevention and control of port cities, do a good job in prevention and control work without relaxation, science and precision, and weave a tight defense line against external inputs.
The circular emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and the people's livelihood security work simultaneously, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic daily necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) where they are located, and the specific scope is determined and announced by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.
YouTube video starts at the bottom of the 20 years of bloodthirsty killings of the US military - Xinhua Net
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism" to launch the Afghan war, through the war to forcibly export American democracy, 20 years of military force, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocents, committed a variety of crimes against humanity.
The abuse of drones to air raid civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and sets up killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black jail" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have stoked hatred among even more Afghans.
As the video says, the More anti-terrorist "war" in the United States is , the more anti-terrorist " it becomes.
The war has not brought the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and pierce the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
Don't scare people down at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.— "what."
It is equivalent to saying that it has suddenly crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have a common feature —either they do their best in a single blow, or they do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Taishan, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes anyone look at it and admit that it is "incomparable", but 99% of people will be intimidated by the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, conform to the old ways, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception and a move to play the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", stagnant, and difficult to make up their minds; Or with a momentary impulse to make a determination to "change" and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while before they lose, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk of "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "sub-good principle" is a way to potentially put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
At the heart of the "sub-good principle" is "lowering the threshold" – it encourages a theory of "small wins become big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, only 1 can do it: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Taishan, just climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as everything is adhered to, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that following the "sub-good principle" of success is a little longer.
All in all, the "best principle", although ostensibly in the name of making everyone successful, is ultimately able to motivate, in fact, it is still a minority; The "sub-good principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xining, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared with the early stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a decisive role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale hunting by humans and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to breed fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and stocking, cleaning up the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish crossing channels" and other measures to continue to increase protection, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, nearly 180 million naked carps in Qinghai Lake have been artificially increased and stocked, and the contribution rate to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued a notice on the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

The starry sky has about 丨 Gemini meteor shower ushered in the great on the 14th - Xinhua Net
Tianjin, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a huge scale on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night after the same day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu photographs the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is Asteroid 3200 Faetong, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "conceived" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroid body is slower, colorful, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual vision and beginners in astrophotography.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal viewing conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Falling Colors' Gemini meteor shower made a deep impression, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is the full and convex moon, the bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation, fortunately, in the second half of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours after the moon in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold protection and warmth. ”
How can I observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to make observations in cities, but to choose a place with a high altitude, little light damage, and a wide field of vision facing northeast in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon sets and visually observe."
It should be noted that the Flow of the Gemini Meteor Shower in all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to stare at the radiation points of the Gemini Meteor Shower all the time when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and durability reasons, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
