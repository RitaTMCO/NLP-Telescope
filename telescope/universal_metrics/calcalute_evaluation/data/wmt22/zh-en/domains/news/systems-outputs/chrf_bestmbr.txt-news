Students play the leading role in the annual academic meeting of Zhejiang University, the research results make people's brains become open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Use the air to wash hands, diagnose diseases with a breath of breath, and accurately search for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brainstorming academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research has covered various fields including the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and so on. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at domestic and international level.
Biosensors: Your Home Physical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smart phone-side biosensor onsite, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a light breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health status of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lights: The doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and inadequate excision of many diseases are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early cancer examination, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under the illumination by adjusting the light spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device uncomfortable".
Just standing on the sink of the device, our body weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world, and won the only gold award.
Chongqing secondary vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admission means prospective employees of the enterprise - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status. After the enrollment is entered, they will be pre-recorded as corporate employees by the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and recruitment procedures of vocational schools and company employment are standardized, and that the dual identities of apprentice students of the secondary vocational school and prospective employees of the company are defined. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and companies sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16, but have not reached the age of 18, the four parties must sign an agreement between the apprentice and guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party, the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentice training on the job.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the form of modern apprenticeships to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post-job internship is generally 6 months.
In the corporate practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has determined 60 pilot projects for municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeships in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprenticeship) have been trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot testing first, and then implementing them, gradually advancing from point to face, explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint student recruitment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students’ job skills, and improve their counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission power but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads more rapidly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physicians group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province in South Africa has reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating are showing mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughs and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have yet required hospitalisation.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In comparison, in the last wave of delta outbreaks, he said, the Covid-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will still be several weeks before enough data is gathered, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary by South Africa’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases: in recent weeks, only 30% of patients hospitalized with the new crown had severe illness, half of the severe proportion of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent new crown patients, only 3% died, and among the cases in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death ratio reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
China Education Review: What to rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no killing," then in a favorable environment where there is no demand of "abducting abduction", mass prevention and control and all people fighting against abduction make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and cost high, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the platform for the emergency release of missing children’s information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app is called "Reunion", I felt very warm勇.
New technology means are not only named "literary and artistic" and full of feelings, but also informatization is used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of cracking down abduction and law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated many "big words".
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
Those matters have to be prioritized and under the urgent "rescue" purpose, the widely discussed and controversial topics such as "whether child abducting and trafficking should be all sent to death" can be put on hold for a little more careful discussion. However, the matter of the rescue of abducted children cannot be awaited.
According to the investigation and handling experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the search for abduction is delayed for an extra minute, the children may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will be increased by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that can directly help to detect cases and retrieve the child.
After all, "combating abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do well.
Fighting crimes and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of judicial order, and the meticulous law enforcement, no need to implement the care of “nurturing children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three resting at a train station, the parents were fast asleep, and they woke up only to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a younger child, you should at least have some level of awareness of protection.
Taking turns between parents and taking a break or keeping their children under secure protection, are the least possible means of preventing child abduction.
From other side of the police's crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who purchases the abducted children should also be paid attention to trafficking and punished.
A single wrongful act is often only one link in a long chain.
According to China's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may be the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The penalties are high and the maximum penalty is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concept of raising children and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official and strict law enforcement.
If the “market” for abduction and abduction exists widely, and the traffickers are constantly innovating the means of trafficking and forming a “fighting” situation with the law enforcement, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking out backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying children.

The Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
The Taiwanese government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who are currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the world of democracy is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the slight flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and push for reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance, more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to run naked in pursuit of power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of continued concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) that we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our number one priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
Tang Feng, a political member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the National Statement through video during a round table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy", emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences on how to fight against the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and took a leadership role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of going backwards as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interest.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without having to close down the city, and we can defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
On the same day of the second day of the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury Department announced that it was imposing sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were identified as severely violating human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Girl used an archery target to raise donations for her sister: "It's okay if I think it's a flesh wound " - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square is standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "target human flesh, ten yuan per arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passersby can use bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity chief of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from The Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such a radical move when she raised donations for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street to "archery target" fundraising admonished
In the pictures posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board with thePod epoxy character. On the wooden board is written the words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" in black ink. On another board in front of her, her bank account, WeChat account, Alipay account number etc. are written on the board.
The image sparked controversy after the picture went online.
Some netizens believed that the move was "begging for eye-catching behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
In an interview with the local media, the police from the Tianshui police station near the incident site stated that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful looks.
Among them, the girl who was doing the "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting for the help, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needs operation expenses. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising donations for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of the publicity officer of the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required a cost of more than 300,000 yuan, I could not think of a good way to raise money, so this behavior was done.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target, and the other was in charge of hitting their hands, but they didn't participate in the process. During the whole process, no one was found to be shooting arrows, but some people were watching. They took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police identified by the public security department, the bow and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of donation-raising method of eyeballs is not advocated."
After being warned by the police station residents, she has already left the police station.
Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival, the national online payment business transaction volume has reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new record high compared to previous years.
The variety reduced red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger, but on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and on contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Generally speaking, Chinese residents have a good performance in financial consumption, but they have great differences in different aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low and the "one old and one young" will remain the focus of continuous attention in financial education; The "Report on Indebtedness of Youth in China" published by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" issued by CCTV finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the younger generation presents a trend of rational consumption as a whole, although some young people are labelled "overexcessive" thus leading to as much social problems and greater financial pressure as they are leading to greater financial risks, financial risks emerge gradually,zipping and corresponding financial risks.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to regulatory calls to improve consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions to raise the rational consumption awareness of the bunch.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including college students, and has also carried out various forms such as in cooperation with Japan's top universities to launch innovation and practice competitions to guide the consumption needs of these young groups. This helps them to establish rational consumption concepts and rational planning of consumption demands, thereby helping them to accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and the correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misunderstandings regarding consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
You must plan ahead when spending, and make repayments on time within your capabilities.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as car buying and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to provide consumers with more adapted and diversified services, continue to help the public to improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a life-long trustworthy consumer financial partner for consumers.
NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council - GCC addresses common challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively impacting the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab states bridging their differences to restore relations with Qatar stem from a demand for unity for the interests of the countries and regional stability, aimed at meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as impossible resolve their missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has initiated direct negotiations with Iran against the background that nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failed to satisfy the wishes of various Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that is slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of any GCC countries since the dispute between some member states with Qatar ended.

The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by long-term accumulation of a university in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since its birth as the world’s first university in modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of “improving the moral merit of the world, and promoting harmony and peace” and took on the patriotic responsibility of “building up the country by promoting learning and strengthening the country凛”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the competition in education, science and technology and talent competition continues to intensify globally. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges for its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines” demonstrates China’s confidence and determination to advance from a major country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, and also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to make efforts to rank among the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking orExceeding on one curve"?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, goals, and abilities, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, late-comer advantage, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving significant improvement in academic level and school-running quality; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom and connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather不行e strength, build brands and enhance images; third, institutional advantages: give full play to the institutional superiority of strong socialist countries, strengthen target-driven, gather consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation and provide sustainable resources for schools to speed up and catch up with advanced world levels.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with one thousand schools and one, each school must demonstrate their individuality and characteristics while giving play to their advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientations, school running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on three outstanding features in running a school: firstly, accentuate the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, build an integrated education environment integrated with the integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, to create a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively foster interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-products; third, highlight the characteristics of university running systems and social services, and carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "study diligently, cultivating morality, discernment, and truthfulness", and "Hainer rivers, inspiring truth and profound ethics, opening up myís and ministers to the people, and building our country up from the ground", together constitute the latest﹑state of the spiritual expression system of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasises the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which embodies the desire to "use the talents out of the world" and expresses the quality concepts of running schools and educating people in the world's top schools. "Inspiring the truth and goodness" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and to be kindness and meaning that while pursuing the truth, the University should receive the edification of morality and the cultivation of character; "New interests, the history of people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, innovation in scientific research, but also the commitment to reform and development. Dedication to national heritage and the nation must also bemoto-based, and the devotion to the promoting of the country and the nation.
These series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running education.
"The wise listen to the silence, and the bright see the invisible".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit can stimulate each other, thereby providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of human beings.

Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and other three Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discriminate against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, the chairman of the group, said at the press conference that, in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of elite American schools has doubled, but in these three prestigious American universities, the proportion of Asian Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities have "persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "combine-based" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, a study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the Department of Education for the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates of Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions after deciding the facts.
They also expect that the colleges and universities being complained of will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the people participating in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
(DW Chinese website) After the "Democracy summit" concluded on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States holding the "Leaders Democracy Summit" was "delineating ideologies, tooling, weaponizing democracy, and in the name of fake democracy, it goes against the reality of democracy, incites division and confrontation, and diverts domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States. For example, some leaders who were invited to attend the meeting include leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect thatitol The real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
“The pathological morbidity of American-style democracy today is fully manifested. Problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and polarization between rich and poor have become intensified,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement on Saturday said, adding that American democracy is a “rich man game” based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, "we must continue to renew it in each generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs champions to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Educational thinking: How to make "students" and "scumbags" their own place during the university examinations - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination and change the type of examination questions, so that the exam would really reflect the students' actual level of demand.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, combined with different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
In the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the test through a concentrated attack before the exam. If they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, it is a "strange situation" that the “skeletal skeleton” can usually pass the test without investment, or even get high marks; “Student masters” usually never fail堂 classes, and the homework and notes are good, and the exams are not much higher than that “strange situation”.
Seeing this, the students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the college examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only of Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote direct letters.
In fact, anyone who has attended college knows that it is not uncommon for people who have gone to university to prepare for an exam and seek out various ways to “trick” exam questions from teachers, trying to delineate the scope of the exams, and obtain “key tutoring” before exams. Even string-like cheat sheets in exams or asking teachers to lightly show their hands after exams are not uncommon.
In the author's opinion, as a guide for teaching quality assessment, to measure the pass or fail of a university examination depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the discipline. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learnt, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examinations are generally composed of question-setting groups, and then the senior teachers of the disciplines coordinate the preparation of examination papers, and the examination papers are also participated by all teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of examination questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question types, and can not only highlight basic knowledge inspections, but also take into account ability assessments, and at the same time, innovatively designsMay flew on types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of examinations are there, and students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University hasOracle University attaches great importance to the letter of suggestion from students, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and post-course examination comparisons on self-checks, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the performance assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
To solve the problems of single types of test questions and duplication of questions from a mechanism are issues that the university exam administration needs to face, of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced. But the work is more expensive in daily life and requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not only to understand the teaching content, but also the students’ learning situation. In order to understand both ends, teaching and learning will be better connected and a positive interaction will be formed. The examination will also be more realistic, so that the "school master" and the "student excluder" have their favorites.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, setting of a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those that are connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who have arrived in land border port cities must at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region意大利 and municipality determines the city scope of the ports and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities may study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the differentiated management policies by different regions has transformed from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clusters of epidemic outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed several problems such as untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some localities, incomplete implementation of closed-loop management of personnel at high-risk positions, and insufficient regular nucleic tests for nucleic acid testing, inadequate elimination of cold chain items in place, irregular management of centralized isolation sites and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be undertaken from nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, accelerated filling of the problems and weaknesses of the prevention and control of port cities, prevention and control work without relaxation, scientific and precise, and weaving close weave and strengthening defense lines against foreign output imports.
The notice emphasized that all port cities should simultaneously research and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and smooth the people's livelihood security hotline, and regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to outstanding issues reported by the masses.residents
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (city, district, flag) that the open land, waterway, and air ports are located: the cities ( ecology's, prefectures, leagues ) and the municipalities where they are located . The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.
YouTube video shows the truth about the bloodthirsty killings of the US military in 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source : You Tube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan War under the name of “anti-terrorism” and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. It used force, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committed various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Abusing drones to air raids on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and establishing killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" to inflict various kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity have inflamed more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terrorism" war is "The more anti-terror, the more terrorism."
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth about the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and uncover the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful studies books.
Most success books today preach "best principles"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It means to say that the “how to do it”, which is actually the most important and fundamental link, has been skipped.
That's why all of these books have one thing in common -- either do your best in an effort, or do nothing at all; either get a 100 or 0; either you climb to Mount Tai, or you just stay put.
This "best principle" will be admitted to "extremely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For someone who sticks to the rules, follows the old rules and refuses to change, you are trying to shout "You want to change" in his ears, which is undoubtedly deceiving oneself and playing a piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people would show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back and find it hard to make up their minds; or they would resign their determination to "transition" on a momentary impulse and take the first step bravely, but often the good times did not last long, and they failed after a long time. It was difficult to see the continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting From Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's capabilities and makes the vast majority of people "walk away and sigh".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is an approach that may be able to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - which encourages a kind of "small wins for the big wins" theory, that is, if you can't achieved 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing at all.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as you persevere in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success by following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is supposed to make everyone succeed on the surface, it actually motivates a small number of people in the end; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resources reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-induced mass killings and the deterioration of the breeding water environment of naked carps, the number of naked carps in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Chinese Red List of Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibits sales of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake entering the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable “fish passages”, continued protection efforts have been continued. The reserves of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources exceeds 23%.
The Three Rivers source region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the eastward spreading of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three river source areas and the Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and built a comprehensive management system for “one river, one river, and one lake”.

The starry sky has an appointment 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great time on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemispheres, the Geminid meteor shower, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower photographed by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that like the Chinese New Year blockbuster, the Geminite meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release date" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
One of the distinguishing features of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids have relatively low speed, of rich colors, and there are also quite a few fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'falling rain' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the exciting level will be reduced a little.
On the 14th, the eleventh day of the lunar month is the lunar vehicle, and the moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in these few hours after the moon is behind in the second half of the night, but pay attention to preventing the cold and keep warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to conduct observations in cities. You can choose a place with a high altitude, less light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing the northeastern direction in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so you don't have to keep staring at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a brilliant "meteor shower blockbuster", it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
