The research results of students playing the leading role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University make people's brains open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with a breath, and accurately searching for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with brain-opening holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value , some of which have been awarded nationally and internationally.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: The Doctor's High-Energy Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"A lot of diseases are detected early, and the excision is not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, in the early stage of cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under illumination.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Our body weight compresses the air just by standing on the sink of the device.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as physical Flu-like symptoms such as pain and cough.
Dr Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have yet to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, in the last wave of Delta, he said, the Covid-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa: Only 30% of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks have severe illness, which is half of the severe proportion of the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the recent new crown disease Only 3% of patients died, compared with 20% of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the world's dominant strain of the new coronavirus, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases in the first week of December, according to health officials, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases.
Education Review: What to Rely on to Save Abducted Children?
If we compare the famous PSA slogan "No business, no killing", then, in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction", mass prevention and control and anti-trafficking will make abduction unprofitable, risky, and costly. high, such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, an emergency release platform for information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technology is not only named "literary and artistic" and full of feelings, but also the informatization is properly used, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated many "big words".
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
Prioritize matters, and under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", such as "whether child abduction should be the death penalty" and other controversial and controversial topics, they can be put on hold and discussed with caution; but the rescue of abducted children, etc. Must not.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to detect the case and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting kidnapping" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the children and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, the parents were asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, at least a fair amount of protection should be exercised.
Taking turns resting between parents, or keeping children under secure protection, is the least possible way to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to my country's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have a backward concept in raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the authorities to strictly enforce the law.
If the “market” for abductions and abductions exists widely, the traffickers are fascinated by their own interests, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a situation of “fighting” with law enforcement officers, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.

The virtual "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how daunting the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
The tyrannical regime can never extinguish the small fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and drive reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to act in the public good. People who were naked in their pursuit of power before.”
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer. "
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees to remain concerned about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced China's rise without a mechanism in place to hold it accountable," he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is why we must change. "
During the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy", Tang Feng, Political Councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting dictatorship and authoritarianism.

"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leadership role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy is showing signs of going backwards.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without shutting down the city, and defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have seriously violated human rights.

NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council to tackle common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively affecting the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
Resolving differences in Gulf Arab states to restore relations with Qatar stems from a demand for solidarity for the interests of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel for citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with a deal between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal the Gulf Arab states have denounced for not being able to solve the missile issue with Iran Agreement to be negotiated.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that failure to address Iran's missile issue and take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran against the backdrop of nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failing to meet the wishes of various Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of the GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Influenced by the advocacy of the value concept of "Ming Virtue, Helping the World, Cultivating Qi and Governing Peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "prospering learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition in education, technology and talent is intensifying all over the world. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates my country's confidence and determination to move from a big country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities. .
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer. By continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and realizing the improvement of academic level and school-running quality The second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by the Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; the third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country To enhance the goal-driven, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running a school: first, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second It is to highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-discipline, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-products; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Industry-university-research cooperation system of Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "studying diligently, cultivating morality, discernment, and truthfulness" and the common values of "inheriting rivers and rivers, inspiring truth and virtue, opening up the former people, and building up our country" together constitute the The latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "using the world's talents for me", and reflects the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people in world-renowned schools; The spirit of kindness refers to the cultivation of morality and the tempering of personalities while pursuing the truth; the spirit of reform and innovation embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of knowledge innovation, scientific research innovation, and performance In order to reform and develop, we must reform the old and make a new one; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and says that the university should always share the same glory and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
These series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are exactly the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silent, the wise see the invisible".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation can stimulate each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian-American groups file complaints against Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest against the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American schools has doubled, but in these three prestigious American schools, the proportion of Asian-Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "combined" admissions process.
According to Zhao Yukong, a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentages of Asian-American admissions, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants. more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after finding the facts.
They also hope that the universities under complaint will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.

The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw lines with ideology. Tooling and weaponizing democracy, pretending to be anti-democracy in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders of 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan's leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both internationally and in the United States. For example, they criticized some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were invited to attend the meeting. Some people suspected that the real intention of the Biden administration was not for the sake of democracy. The summit was organized for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is morbid, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party confrontation, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, and polarization between the rich and the poor are intensifying." A "rich man's game" built on capital.
US President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks. And those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
Democracy is not something to be taken for granted, he stressed, "We have to renew it in every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend."
The U.S. pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long campaign that includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Educational thinking: How to make "student tyrants" and "student scumbags" get their own way in college exams - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the type of exam questions to make the exam truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, combined with different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may pass the exam by focusing on the attack before the test. If they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a "strange situation" that "student scumbags" can pass the test without any investment, and even get high marks; .
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the university examinations are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote directly.
In fact, anyone who has gone to college knows that it is not uncommon to prepare for the test unexpectedly, to "take" test questions from teachers in various ways, to try to delineate the scope of the test, and to obtain "key tutoring" before the test, even in the test. It is not uncommon to have cheat sheets and begged teachers to raise their hands after exams.
In the author's opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation guide, measuring the passing of a university examination depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically subject-based theories and basic common sense. From a knowledge point of view, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, test groups are generally formed into question groups, and then senior teachers of the subject co-ordinate the test papers to form the test papers. The examination papers are also participated by all the teachers responsible for the subject, so that the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of test questions that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation. The difficulty of the questions is normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so as to make the test propositions difficult, easy, and difficult. The question type has a dynamic grasp, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question type.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of recommendation from students, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course end-of-course examinations, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of test paper propositions and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen curriculum teaching. Comprehensive examination.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content thoroughly, It is even more necessary to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, and to understand both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and examinations will be more realistic, so that "students" and "students" have their own place.

He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.

He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah birth papers is different from other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring them to leave the land border port cities (connected with Hong Kong and Macau) in the near future. Persons who travel to land border ports and cities must have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, region and city determines the port city scope and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing a differentiated management policy by region, changing from one line of defense against spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimal social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered epidemics in my country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice points out that this has revealed that some local epidemic monitoring and early warning are not timely, closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is a mere formality, cold chain items are not properly sterilized, the management of centralized isolation places is not standardized, and epidemic emergency response.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, assuming or implying that you can "do" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" has been skipped all at once.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either do your best in one go, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; either you will climb Mount Tai, or you will simply stay where you are. wait.
This kind of "best principle" will admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For someone who sticks to the rules, conforms to the old rules, and refuses to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly deceiving yourself and playing the piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people will show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back and make up their minds; It's not long, and it won't last for a while, and it's hard to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, and makes most people "sigh and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a path that has the potential to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a "small wins for big wins" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0 ; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" on the surface is under the banner of making everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire only a small number of people; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate as many people as possible. to benefit more people.

Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to a large number of human hunts and the deteriorating environment of naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially propagated and released, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in my country and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year.

Starry sky has an appointment 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great deal on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers Observations can be made in the second half of the day.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, said that just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of meteoroids, rich colors, and a lot of fireballs, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum time of ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant is directly overhead, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) is 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Beautiful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, which will be a little less exciting.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the second half of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keeping warm and cold. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then you can observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so there is no need to stare at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower all the time.
If you like photography, if you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
