The research results of students singing the lead role at the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference make people brain-Xinhua
Use air to wash your hands, judge diseases in one breath, and accurately search for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research covers various fields such as the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
Zhang Diming's team, a PhD student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a smartphone biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
“You only need to take a gentle breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the components of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming explained that this sensor set is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor set uses a new material such as graphene. Its target is a chemical element, and its keen “sense of smell” allows it to reflect physical health more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eye
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“The lack of early detection and resection of many diseases is related to the lights used in doctors' operating rooms. ”
Shin Junfei said, for example, during an early cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue clearly in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates. By adjusting the spectrum, the distinction between different tissues under light is enhanced.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, etc., and received good feedback.
In October of last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, wiping soap at most, and squeezing hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of “air hand washing devices.”
As long as we stand on the sink of the device, our body weight can compress the air out.
“It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! ”
Color development and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top schools and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrollment Is a Prospective Employee of an Enterprise-Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot a “modern apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students receiving pilot training will also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-registered as unit employees of the pilot enterprises.
Municipal Education Commission requires, standardize secondary vocational school enrollment and enterprise employment procedures, clarify the dual status of apprentices secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees, in accordance with the two-way selection principle, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, for apprentices aged 16 and above but not 18 years old, must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and specific positions, teaching and training of apprentices on the job Contents , protection of rights and interests, etc.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot uses the training academic system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The induction internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, an enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city identified 60 municipal middle vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches. The number of each pilot was about 50, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradual promotion from point to point, the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training, and integrated education of people is explored, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students' counterparts.
China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children “high-tech” pass “June 1st” - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of May 20 from Beijing (Huang Xiaoxi and Zhou Shanshan) - The reporter learned from the China Children's Center on the 20th that around the “June 1st” Children's Day from May 28 to June 1, the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as a children's maker experience, a children's visual arts festival, and a parent-child book incense carnival, so that children can spend “June 1st” in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
According to information, the activities held by the China Children's Center during the “June 1st” Children's Day this year include the “Love Family, Create Cool” Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Visual Arts Festival, the “Book Fragrance Carnival” event, and the “Family Loves Reading” picture book series.
Li Zhongming, deputy director of the China Children's Center, explained at the 2016 “June 1st” Children's Day media briefing held on the 20th that the “Love Family and Create Cool” Children's Future Learning Carnival is a key event for the China Children's Center to celebrate “June 1st” this year.
The event focuses on organically combining social innovation with family creativity, and experiencing various innovative educational activities through the participation of children and families, so that innovative practices become the cultural genes of popular families, and “hands-on” become a new way of learning and living for families.
It is reported that the “Love Your Family and Create Cool” Children's Future Learning Carnival includes dozens of cutting-edge science and technology experiences such as the “Douguo Maker” experience event, the anniversary celebration of the Old Niu Children's Exploration Hall and the “Exploring the Family Loves Children for June 1st” event, the VR National Experience Program, and the “Maker Tribe” interactive workshop.
South African doctor: Omik Jung has strong transmission power, but most of them are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omik Jung variant of the coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press report, with the spread of the Omik Jung variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors from Gauteng Province in South Africa formed a physicians' organization to report that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have relatively mild symptoms, such as physical pain and cough, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have yet to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine,” Pillay said. ”
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to become seriously ill due to coronavirus infection.
He said that in comparison, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated “had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days”.
Two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the Omiquillon mutated strain, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by South Africa's National Institute of Infectious Diseases: Of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% were seriously ill, half the severe rate of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average length of hospitalization was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and of the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, and of the early outbreaks in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: “Currently, almost all indications indicate that it is a milder disease. ”
He also said, “It's still early days, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic for two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalizations, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the main COVID-19 strain in the world, Omikjon cases are occurring in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests showed that the Omik Jung variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Education Review: What do we rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service advertising slogan “No killing without buying or selling”, then in a favorable environment where there is no demand for “abduction”, mass prevention and control and anti-abduction by the whole population make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and expensive, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, an emergency release platform for information on missing children developed by the Abduction and Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went live.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app was called “Reunion”, I felt very warm.
The new technological means are not only named “literature and art” and are full of feelings, but informatization is also properly used, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against abduction is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be cited as many “big words”.
However, before abduction and trafficking cases come to an end, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Prioritize matters. Under the urgent purpose of “rescue”, topics that are widely divided and controversial, such as “whether child abduction and trafficking should always be the death penalty”, can be put aside and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on their experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as they succeed.
If the abduction hunt is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the “Reunion” platform that directly helps to detect cases and recover children.
After all, “abduction” is a major task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
Combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulous enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care of “caring for young children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, parents are asleep, and only wake up to find that the child is gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a fair sense of protection.
Both parents taking turns resting or placing the child under secure protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
Looking at the other side of the police's fight against abduction and trafficking crimes, parties that buy abducted children should also receive attention and punishment.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscation will be imposed.
The sentence is high and the maximum sentence is heavy. Under the general trend of “light punishment”, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a crime with heavier penalties.
However, there are still quite a few cases of abduction and trafficking that occur every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in their views on raising children and have little legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely on strict government enforcement alone.
If there is a widespread “market” for abduction, abductors and traffickers are tempted to profit, continue to innovate methods of abduction and trafficking, and form a “fight” situation with law enforcement officials, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into an inefficient muddle.
Therefore, breaking down the concept of backwardness and popularizing common sense of the law will also help root out the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying of children.

Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online “Summit for Democracy” (Summit for Democracy) (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by 110 governments around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the 2nd global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative and government councilor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, “We know how arduous the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is ubiquitous.
Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the flames of freedom that are burning in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
“As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, forces that are more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to blatantly pursue power before the public interest,” he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with “International Human Rights Day”.
UN Secretary General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
“Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
“For a long time, the world has always been affected by the rise of China, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority. ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
He said, “Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, or maybe some of you don't realize the threat [the Chinese Communist Party] is to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. ”
While attending a roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values”, Tang Feng, government member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released the “National Statement” via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of confronting authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight COVID-19 through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said, “At a time when democracy in Taiwan is on the rise, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective interest, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we can overcome fake information without being removed from the shelves. ”
At the same time as the schedule for the second day of the “Democracy Summit” was underway, the US Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, in accordance with the law, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company recognized as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: “It's okay to think it's sarcasm” - Xinhua
A girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large wooden board with the words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of “Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister” blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person. The words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” were written on the board, signaling passers-by to use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The act triggered a buzz among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Xinjing News reporters that the police confirmed that the girl made such an aggressive move only to raise money for her sister, but this kind of behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street “arrow target” fundraising admonished
In the picture circulated online, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board in the font “one”. The words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” were written on the board in black ink. Her bank account number, WeChat, Alipay account, etc. were written on the other wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a “begging act of Bo's eyeballs,” and many netizens also expressed sympathy for this.
“We discovered what we discovered when we patrolled the square at around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were already quite a few onlookers. ”
Police officers at the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stalls, both around the age of 20, and dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who works as a “human target” has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; the other girl is on the side to help sipping, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery now, so please help everyone.
“We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told Xinjing News reporters that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and raised donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since treatment still costs more than 300,000, it was impossible to think of a good way to raise funds for a while, and only then did this act be carried out.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target and the other was responsible for laying hands, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police assessed by the public security department that the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, “This kind of blog eyeball fundraising method is not advocated.”
She had already left the police station after being warned by the police station residents.
Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of “Double 12” - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
This year's “Double Eleven” carnival nationwide online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
A wide variety of red envelopes have been reduced, and the eye-catching live streaming of goods has once again allowed consumers to shout for benefits. On the one hand, this consumer boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is getting stronger and stronger, and on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and mainstream contemporary consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of “Double 12”, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jiexin”) issued a rational consumption initiative, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the “Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report” released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and “one old, one young” will continue to be the focus of financial education. The “Report on the Debt Status of Young People in China” released by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, with 86.6% of young people They all use credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is very different from the label of “excessive splurge” labeled by the outside world, some young people do consume excessively and follow the trend. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have arisen, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave in assuming social responsibility and conducting positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and responding positively to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people, with practical actions.
Over the years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for youth groups including university students. Through various forms such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top institutions in China, Jiexin has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people in various forms, such as innovative practice competitions, etc., to help them establish a rational consumption concept, rationally plan consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings about consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
Be sure to plan ahead when spending, and repay on time if you can.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect future economic life such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can trust for life.
Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “unity and stability.”
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Arab countries of the Gulf to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stem from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, with the aim of meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman this time, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) — an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab countries for believing it impossible to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and Iran's nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to take no action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations against the backdrop of nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failing to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.

Let university spirit resonate with zeitgeist at the same frequency-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of ideas and value pursuits that a university has accumulated over a long period of time during its development. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in China, it emerged in the fall of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the value concept of “Ming De Ji Shi, repairing the peace” and the patriotism of “developing a strong country”.
Currently, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. Global competition in education, science and technology, and talent continues to intensify. As an important “supply side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the “Overall Plan for Coordinated Promotion of the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines”, while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a major country with higher education to a higher education power, also places higher and newer requirements on university development.
How can we strive to rank among the most popular in the world in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a certain gap, and achieve “overtaking cars in corners”?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, self-confidence in path, and self-confidence in ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, latecomer advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to unite strength. Shaping the brand and enhancing the image; the third is to give full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, gather consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is important to realize that building a world-class university cannot be one of a thousand schools. While giving full play to its advantages, each school must show its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school traditions, and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, and to build an integrated and nurturing environment integrating science and education and school-enterprise to form a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment where disciplines intersect, and actively cultivating cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic intersecting achievements; third, Highlight the characteristics of the school running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of an industry-university-research cooperation system at Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit so that the university spirit and the zeitgeist resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “seeking truth and innovation”, the common values of “studying diligently, practicing morality, discerning, and being truthful” and “the Haina River, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening things up to the people before us, and building our country” together form the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, “Haina River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mind of “the world's talents for my use”, and manifests itself in drawing on the high-quality concept of world-famous schools to run schools and educate people; “enlightenment and virtue” emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and the best spirit of kindness, which means that universities are more motivated by virtue and personality while pursuing truth; “opening things before people” embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including The search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research also manifests itself in reform and development, revolutionizing the past; “Shoring Our State” emphasizes patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share common honor and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year run school.
“The wise hear silently, and the wise see the invisible”.
Chinese colleges and universities should further build on the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the direction of the times and historical mission in which higher education undertakings are located, and accelerate their construction into world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university stir up each other with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the prosperity and strength of the country and the revitalization of the nation, and the realization of the common ideals

Asian American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment at 3 prestigious Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of May 23 from Washington D.C. (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the enrollment process at three prestigious Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American schools has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities “consistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong explained that research by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have imposed a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect that after filing the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment after determining the facts.
They also expect the colleges and universities complained of to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies for Asians.
Currently, the three colleges and universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions from Harvard University, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups participating in the complaint this time, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani origin in the United States were also included.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese.com) After the “Democracy Summit” ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a speech on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States held the “Leadership Democracy Summit”, which “drew ideological lines, instrumentalized democracy, weaponized, and acted as anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incited division and confrontation, and diverted domestic contradictions”.
The Chinese government believes that “for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
“Democracy” has long become a “weapon of mass destruction” for America to interfere with other countries.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was conducted via video. Leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend the conference, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for having problems with America's own democracy, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questioning voices internationally and within the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies were criticized for being invited to the conference, such as leaders of countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some suspected that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz, who just took office, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
A statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, “Today's American-style democracy is sickening. Problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and polarization between rich and poor are intensifying.” America's democracy is a “rich man's game” based on capital.
US President Joe Biden said in his speech, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, forces that are more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to blatantly pursue power before the public interest. “
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. “We must constantly update it with every generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time. “
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights “need fighters to defend in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges”.
The US side promised to launch a one-year action after this democracy summit, including a US$424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, “Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year”.
Educational Thoughts: How to Make “School Bullies” and “Learn Slag” Get Their Own Place in College Examinations-Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to university leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exam, and making demands to make the exam more difficult and change the exam question type so that the exam can truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a “hot topic” for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, and their ability levels vary. Coupled with varying degrees of study, the study conditions vary greatly.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question type is single and the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not have any merit may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on surprise attacks before the exam. If they think about other methods, they may achieve the effect of doing more with less.
As a result, there is a “strange status quo” where “learning slag” can usually pass the level without investing, and even get a high score; “school bullies” usually never drop out of class, their homework and notes are good, and exams are not much higher.
In this way, students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems that exist in university examinations are not without cause, and I believe this situation does not only exist at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these 3 students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that it is not uncommon to surprise exam preparation, find various ways to “extract” exam questions from teachers, try to draw the scope of the exam, and get “key counseling” before the exam. It is not unusual to even include a small copy in the exam and ask the teacher to exalt himself after the exam.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring whether or not a university exam passes or fails depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many major courses focus on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university exam.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, “I studied the basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago, and I'm still studying it now, which is still the focus. ”
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the exam question type is single or the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, examination groups are generally formed, and examination papers are co-ordinated by senior teachers of the subject. Examination papers are also read with the participation of all teachers in charge of the subject, so that repetition of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning. According to the overall situation of students' learning, the questions are easily distributed normally. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the students' degree of learning, so that the exam propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability test, and innovate the question type.
The exam is the baton of university education. If there is any kind of exam, students will have a corresponding exam preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University campus attaches great importance to the students' proposal letters and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct discussions and comparative self-checks on course closing examinations, formulate exam paper propositions and related systems. At the same time, they strengthen supervision and inspection of exam paper propositions and review links, refine the evaluation of results, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanically solving the problems of single test question type, repeated topics and other issues that university examinations need to face. Of course, a corresponding system needs to be introduced, but kung fu is expensive on a daily basis, requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation, both ends thoroughly, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a virtuous interaction, the exam will also be more in line with reality, so that the “school bully” and “Learn slag” Each has its own place.

He said that the related issues had arisen 2 months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers that produce specially made anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which delayed delivery to our country. ”
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah newspaper paper is different from other regions, so it is not possible to trade stocks belonging to other states.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month. Later, it was handed over to a printing company on the 8th to carry out some printing work.

“We will inform applicants to go to local branches to collect registration papers. ”
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

Negative nucleic acid for 48 hours, set up a “buffer zone” The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 11 from Beijing (by staff reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) - The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to have a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, region and city determines the port city scope and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities that are in a position to do so can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control in their jurisdictions.
Relevant officials from the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission explained that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a zoning differentiated management policy, changing from one line of defense for spillover prevention and control to two lines of defense, is expected to move the gate forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks in China, all imported from abroad through port cities.
The above notice points out that this revealed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate killing of cold chain items in all aspects, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of shortcomings in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job of prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and tighten the foreign defense import defense line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and livelihood security work, publish and unblock livelihood security hotlines, regularly investigate emerging hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, etc., and promptly resolve and proactively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the county (city, district, flag), city (prefecture, state, league) and municipality directly under the Central Government where open land, waterway and air ports are located. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.
The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the US military in 20 years-Xinhua
(Video source: Tubing)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called “Killing Machine” on the tubing platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan under the name of “anti-terrorism”, forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. In 20 years, it committed various crimes against humanity by using military force, bloodthirst, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Misuse of drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distort humanity, and set up murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a “black prison” to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the “suspects”.
A crime against humanity stirs up the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war “becomes more anti-terrorist”.
The war brought no hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people; it brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poking at the video, let's debunk the truth about America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism”, and poke through the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
Don't scare people off at the starting line-Xinhua
When I visit the book market, I often feel the popularity of books on successful studies.
Many of today's success studies books promote the “best principle” — that is, assume or imply that you can “do it” first, and then tell “what” you need to do.
It's tantamount to saying that all of a sudden we have crossed the “how to do it”, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic — either you work hard to your best, or you just don't do anything; it's 100, or it's 0; or you climb Mount Taishan, or you just stay where you are.
This kind of “best principle” makes anyone who sees it admit to being “extremely correct”, but 99% of people will be intimidated by the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you have to make up your mind, become a human again, and make a big 180-degree transformation”, and this is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For people who stick to the rules, follow the old, and refuse to change, you prefer to shout “You want to change” in his ear, which is undoubtedly an act of deceiving oneself and playing piano against cattle.
The vast majority of people are timid in the face of the word “transformation”, and it is difficult to make up their minds; or they decide to “change” with a momentary impulse and pain, and bravely take the first step, but often the good picture is not long, and they lose the battle without persisting for a while, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic “Starting Tomorrow” is the most evocative expression of this classic of “universal humanity”.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of the abilities of ordinary people, causing the vast majority of people to “look at the door and sigh.”
Perhaps the “second best principle” is a way that is likely to allow more ordinary people to embark on a path of relative success.
The core of the “second best principle” is “lowering the threshold” — it encourages the theory of “winning small wins big wins”, that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is never greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Taishan, you can just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that's always better than stepping where you are.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Since the threshold has been drastically lowered, it is more likely that ordinary people will persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the path to success following the “second best principle” is a bit longer.
All in all, the “best principle”, although ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, is actually a minority that it can ultimately inspire; and the “second best principle” can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year.-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the bare carp resource reserves of Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year over the previous year to 108,500 tons. Compared with the beginning of protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake bare carp, commonly known as “mackerel”, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, the number of bare carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to factors such as mass manslaughter and the deteriorating environment in the breeding waters of bare carp. In 2002, the bare carp resource reserves in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, naked carp from Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the “Red List of Chinese Species”.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has imposed a closure on the lake to raise fish. It prohibits any unit, group or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the Lake District, and prohibits the sale of bare carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through measures such as artificial breeding and discharging, cleaning up the main rivers entering the lake in Qinghai Lake, and scientifically and reasonably designed “fish crossing channels”. The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, explained that up to now, nearly 180 million tails of bare carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially bred and discharged, contributing more than 23 percent to the recovery of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued anti-fishing notices in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has established a “one river, one river, one lake” comprehensive ban management system.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing the Management of Rural Public Welfare Jobs-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Kunming (by staff reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continue to do a good job of providing employment assistance to the people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced policies related to promoting rural revitalization and the management of rural public welfare jobs to help promote rural revitalization comprehensively.
Relevant officials from the Yunnan Provincial Department of People's Social Affairs explained that at present, 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan to place employment for disadvantaged rural groups such as pro-poor laborers. They play an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation attacks, and effectively enhance the capacity of various rural public services.

Cases of Omiquelon strain infection detected for the first time in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Beijing - Comprehensive reports from Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time cases of infection with the novel coronavirus mutated virus Omikron strain.
Mauritius first reported two cases of infection with the Omiquelon strain in the country on the 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist departing from South Africa and arriving in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected was a native Mauritian resident. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, both infected people tested negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on the 10th the country's first confirmed cases of infection with the Omikron strain.
All three were students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital for treatment because they were all mild illnesses.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik Jong strain, the Serbian government has continuously stepped up its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and over entering the country by air will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
Serbia's Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country detected three cases of Omikejon strain infection for the first time.

There's an appointment in the starry sky丨The Gemini meteor shower ushered in a big way on the
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Tianjin (by staff reporter Zhou Runjian) - Astronomical science experts explained that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely large on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night after that day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu filmed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent object of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200 asteroid Faetong, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second meteor shower currently known not to be “bred” by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science expert, explained that just like Lunar New Year blockbusters, Gemini meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the “release schedule” can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high flow and stability. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is called the top three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor body is slow, colorful, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astronomy beginners to shoot.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing filmed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the overhead under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
“Last year, people were deeply impressed by the 'colorful setting' Gemini meteor shower, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the degree of excitement will be slightly discounted.
The 14th is November 11 of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a bulging moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with observations. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the middle of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours after the moon sets in the middle of the night, but be careful to keep warm from the cold. ”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in a city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing the northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon sets to observe visually.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a lot of flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing it.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster film', it's best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, battery backup, and shutter cables are also essential for stability and continuity. ”
Xiu Lipeng cautioned.
