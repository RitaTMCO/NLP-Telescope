Zhejiang University art annual student singing protagonist research results open the mind - new Chinese network
Wash hands with air, judge diseases, accurately search for the source of fog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, research covering environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and other major fields, students from a curious idea to create many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have been awarded internationally.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
Dr. Zhang Diong, a PhD student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smartphone side, only half the size of a smartphone.
“You just have to breathe a light breath, and this set of instruments will be able to preliminarily detect your health from the composition of the gas you breathe.”
Zhang said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will appear on the phone.
The smart bracelet that can detect health conditions on the market, generally detects physical parameters such as temperature, pulse.
The biosensor uses a new type of graphene material, its target material is chemical elements, and its sharp "smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lights: The Doctor’s High Energy Eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart lights are also used in the surgery room.
The invention won the Silver Prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Show this year.
Zhou Lin Yuan, a master's student at the Faculty of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and the team of Shenzhen Fei opened a new way of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgical light.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's surgery room."
Shen Fei said that, for example, when examining cancer early, if doctors can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four discs that enhance the difference between different organizations under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness depending on the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated children's hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the National Challenge Cup first prize.
Washing Hands With Air: Water Saving and Cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, scratch a little soap, press a little hand wash, and Li Khalifa and other students invented a set of "air hand washing devices".
As long as we stand on the toilet of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a light bulb.
The compressed air forms a fluid in the head of the drone and joins with water.
So we can wash our hands!”
Experiments with color reactions and bacterial residues show that the effect of hand washing with this method is the same as with ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, both to ensure the level of cleaning, but can save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second major global challenge summit, the invention stood out among many of the world’s top universities and won the only gold prize.

South African doctors: Omicorn transmission is strong but more slight
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omicorn variation is milder than the delta variation, although it spreads faster.
With the spread of the Omick variation in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa’s Houden province that patients who are currently treated with the new coronavirus have had milder symptoms, such as physical pain and coughing.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he looks at dozens of patients every day, but that no one needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: “They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation.”
This, he said, includes elderly patients and those with health problems who would have been more prone to fall into severe conditions due to coronavirus infections.
He said in comparison to the previous wave of the delta epidemic, he treated new crown patients with "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized within a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report in South Africa of the Omick variation strain, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to gather enough data, medical observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks were serious, half the severity rate of the previous wave; the average hospital stay time was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent new coronavirus patients died, and 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as saying: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a more mild disease.”
He added: “It’s still too early and we need back-to-back data.
Typically, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only have two weeks to get into this wave of epidemics.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world’s leading strain of the new coronavirus, Omick virus cases are emerging in dozens of countries, South Africa being the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases discovered in Houden province increased by 400 percent in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Education Time Review: What to Save Kidnapped Children?
If compared with the famous public welfare advertising phrase "without buying and selling, there is no killing", then in a good environment without the need for "collapse", group control and people's counter-collapse, so that the smuggling is unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the criminal investigation Bureau of the Ministry of public security kidnapped the disappearance of children's information emergency release platform.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the disclosure of information about missing children and the timely retrieval of abducted children.
The app is called “United” and is very warm.
The new technological means are not only called "literature" and filled with emotions, but also informational use is proper, practical and effective.
The primary objective of the law enforcement is to recover the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the victim’s personal safety before the case is resolved.
The matter is very urgent, and under the urgent purpose of "searching for rescue", such as "should child trafficking be punished with the death penalty" such as widespread and controversial topics, can be postponed and cautiously discussed; but the rescue of kidnapped children is not allowed.
According to the detective experience of such cases, traffickers tend to move away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible.
If the operation is delayed by one minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of investigating the case will increase by one point.
In this case, to come up with effective methods such as a "unification" platform that directly helps in the detection of cases and the retrieval of children is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, “robbery” is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the tightness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "care for the weak."
In addition, prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, parents slept, awakened only to find the child is missing.
You can’t expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
The alternate rest of both parents, or the placement of the child under proper protection, is the least measure to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police’s fight against the crime of smuggling, a party buying kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual misconduct is often only part of a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the statutory sentence for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; in especially serious circumstances, it can be sentenced to death and confiscate property.
High punishment, the highest punishment, under the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is clearly a heavier crime.
There are still many smuggling cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in the concept of raising children and lack of legal awareness.
Legal education for this part of the people should be followed in parallel.
To effectively control the crime of smuggling, it is not possible to rely solely on official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" of the bribery is widespread, the bribery of the dealer will constantly innovate the means of the bribery, form the "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the bribery will inevitably fall into the mud of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking backward ideas, popularizing legal common sense, also helps to eradicate child trafficking and buying off crime.

Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom never goes out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders, opened on Friday (10 December).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global “Democracy Summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative, political affairs commissioner Tang Feng, and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights activist, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: “We know how difficult the work is ahead of us.
But we also know that we can face the challenge because, as I said before, as this summit showed, democracy is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime will never quench the micro-fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: “As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen our democracy, to push for reform, to transparent accountability and governance, to be more resistant to the forces of autocratic buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.”
The theme of the next day of the “Democracy Summit” will be defending human rights, consolidating democracy and opposing authoritarianism, as well as counteracting digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that democracy faces challenges globally, especially the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.
“It is time to reaffirm our shared values and positions and our democratic resilience.”
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the exploitation of all the tools offered by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong’s Democratic Human Rights activist, Ron Yong, spoke at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, including Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: “For a long time, the world has accepted China’s rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold accountable.
That’s why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority.”
Rouhani also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party.
“Maybe some of you are afraid to irritate General Secretary Xi, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that is the reason we failed.
This is also why we need to change.”
During the round table of discussions on “Fighting Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values”, Taiwan’s executive committee’s Governing Affairs Commissioner, Tang Feng, released the “National Statement” via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shares his experience with how to combat the new coronavirus through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: “At a time when Taiwan’s democracy is growing, we are always firmly at the forefront of global confrontation with authoritarianism, and we play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retreat.
In Taiwan, however, we don’t have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don’t have to shut down it to defeat fake news.”
Simultaneously with the next day of the “Democracy Summit”, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to be seriously violating human rights, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

A girl in Hangzhou Wooling Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl gonna be a'shoot target' for sister funding" exploded the circle of friends.
Photographs show that a girl in Hangzhou Wooling Square stood in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a man, and the wooden board was written "human-meat target, ten yuan one arrow", indicating that passers can use archery to shoot after payment.
The move has sparked interest among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's downtown branch confirmed to the New York Times reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive move for her sister to raise donations, but this behavior is not worthy of encouragement, after warning, the girl had left the local station yesterday.

On the eve of the "Twelve Twelve" to advocate rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observatory Network - professional financial and economic news site
This year, the amount of national network payment business transactions reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
A variety of full red packages, catching the eye of live broadcasts once again to benefit consumers, this consumption boom on the one hand makes people feel sorry that the national consumption power is growing strong, on the other hand, we must also calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the "double twelve", JSC Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "JSC") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excess consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Finance Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, up from 2.04 in 2019 compared with 2018.
Overall, China's residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, there is also a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, "old and little" will still be the focus of continued attention to financial education; Nielsen's "China youth debt report" and the "China youth consumption report 2019-2020" released by Central Bank of Finance showed that the younger generation has a huge consumer potential, credit consumption became an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, almost half of the people have no debt accumulation, and even if the younger generation as a whole shows rational consumption trends, although the "excessive volatility" label on the outside world is very different, but some young people do have excessive consumption, follow-up consumption behavior, and therefore generate excessive financial pressure and debt risk,
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JSC has been committed to helping people to build their own happy lives with high-quality and attentive services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of regulators to raise the consumption consciousness of consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, JSC has continuously targeted young groups, including university students, to carry out comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge dissemination activities, and through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practices competitions and other forms of subversion, to rationally guide the consumer needs of young groups, help them to establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and help them to accumulate wealth.
At the time of the arrival of the twelve, JSC reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and the correct money view, resist blind consumption and excess consumption, and avoid the mistake of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan in advance, measure and pay back on time.
If delayed, the delayed record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic life such as buying a car, buying a home.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, JSC will as always, with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and continuously updated iterative financial products, bring consumers more suitable for demand and diversified services, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption, moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner.
Vietnamese People's Press Network - The Gulf Cooperation Committee Resolves Common Challenges
Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Sea Society and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Committee in January 2021 when the Gulf nations signed an agreement on “solidarity and stability” between the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are appointing new ambassadors in Qatar through the two countries, leading efforts to restore ties with Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries have resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar as a result of demands that countries must unite for their interests and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi prince’s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer channel will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with companies of the two countries signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran and world powers negotiating a nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to save Iran — a deal the Gulf Arabs have condemned for being unable to solve Iran's missile issue.
The Gulf nations have seen Iran as a long-standing “competitor” and viewed Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf nations believe that it is a flaw not to address the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
The aim is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slowed the country’s economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming summit will be the first summit of the association countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Committee to re-evaluate diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf and to propose measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the frequency - China Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school ideas and values pursued by a university that have been formed in the long-term process of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the university spirit has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first university in the modern sense of the world, the university has taken on the unique mission of different from other social organizations, for our university, rising in the autumn of the national crisis, its spirit is more deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the value concept of "Mindzhi, consolidate and consolidate" and the patriotism of the "expanding power".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology and talent competition is constantly increasing, and higher education as an important "supply side", its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan to promote world-class universities and first-class disciplines, while demonstrating the confidence and determination of our country to move from higher education powers to higher education powers, has also put forward higher and renewed requirements for university development.
How to work to rank among the world's most popular in a relatively short time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, to the "curve overcar"?
In addition to firmly establishing the goal of self-confidence, the path of self-confidence, the ability of self-confidence, the university should also give full play to three advantages: one is to develop advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents overseas, learn to draw from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to a significant increase in academic level and quality of school; the second is the cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom of the Chinese civilization in the five thousand years of accumulation, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shape brands, improve the image; the third is the system advantages, play the system superiority of the socialist country, strengthen the goal drive, gather consensus, optimize the allocation of resources, to accelerate
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university on one side, and at the same time, each school must showcase its individuality and characteristics.
School characteristics must have Chinese characteristics in common, but also reflect their respective unique objectives, school tradition and resources.
As for Zhejiang University, we emphasize the three characteristics of the school: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent training, build the integrated foster environment of science and education, the integration of university and university enterprises, and form the entire chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to highlight the characteristics of the cross-disciplinary meeting, promote the optimization of the disciplinary system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate the emerging cross-disciplinary and iconic cross-disciplinary achievements; the third is to highlight the school system and social services characteristics, carry out deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Pan Zhejiang university research and cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the schooling of "Innovation is the pursuit of innovation", the common values of "study, practice, understanding and practice" and the "Hina River, Hina Truth, Fatherland, Tree and Country" together constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of school, constantly accumulate cultural heights and consolidate spiritual forces, rich in content and far-reaching meaning.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the "heavenly talent for me" mindset, and acts as the high-quality philosophy of attracting the world's famous schools to educate; "Isaiah's Truthfulness" emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, refers to the university in the pursuit of truth at the same time, and accepts the hardships of German art and personality; "Isaiah's people" refers to the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, but also acts as reform and development, revolution and innovation; "Tree my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, and speaks of the university should always share honour
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit is where the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
“The wise hears in silence, and the wise sees in the unseen.”
Chinese universities should further build on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the current position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanitarian care and freedom of independence, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation intertwined, thereby providing an inexhaustible momentum for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

American-American groups complain of Yale and other 3 frequently-Jitsu famous school enrollment discrimination - Xinhua Network
More than 130 Asian groups in the U.S. filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on 23 May to protest that three famous universities — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College — discriminated against Asian applicants during their enrollment.
The Asian Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group’s chairman, Zhao宇空, said at the conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria for U.S. top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian students in these three U.S. top schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have “long-term continuity and systematically discriminated against Asian applicants” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” of the enrollment process.
Zhao宇空 said that a 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed that in these three colleges, the relative number of applicants, the Asian admission rate is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that of all U.S. universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented ethnic quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao宇空 told Xinhua news agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after filing a complaint and take measures to prevent the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their enrollment.
They also expect the universities that have been complained to actively address this issue and change the admissions policy for Asian people.
Three universities have not yet responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015 when it complained of Harvard admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups also participated in the complaint.
After the "democracy summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said on Saturday (11 December) that the United States hosted the "leadership of the people's leaders summit", is "to ideological lines, to democratic tools, weapons, counter-democracy in the name of the false democracy, incite separation confrontation, and transfer domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on the people, promoting 'democratic transformation', abusing unilateral sanctions, and curating 'colour revolution', with catastrophic consequences."
‘Democracy’ has long been the ‘weapon of mass destruction’ for U.S. interference in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
During the two-day video conference, leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the emergence of American own democracy, saying the United States was unqualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning both internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invited attendance of some authoritarian leaders such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who suspect the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Scholz also attended a video democracy summit.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "Today's American-style democracy disease is evident, money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social splitting, racial contradictions, poverty and wealth segregation and other issues are growing, and America's democracy is based on capital-based "rich game".
In his speech, President Biden said, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen our democracy, to drive reform, to transparent accountable governance, to be more resilient to the powers of autocratic buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.”
He emphasized that democracy is not a matter of course, "we must constantly renew it in every generation, which, in my opinion, is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "are faced with ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign following the Democratic Summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The U.S. hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the planned Real Democracy Summit in late 2022.
Biden said, “Let all countries carry out our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year.”
Educational Thinking: How to Make University Exams “Scientist” “Scientist” Everything – China Network
3 students of Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school's leaders, reflecting the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the exam type, so that the exam truly reflects the student's actual level of appeal.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a “hot topic”.
At the university campus, students come from five lakes across the sea, the level of competence is different, plus the degree of study is different, and the study situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for groups with such multiple characteristics to be evaluated.
Of course, if the test topic type is single, the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not use the talent, may concentrate on the strike before the exam, if you think about other methods, it is possible to half the effect.
As a result, there is a "study junk" that is not used in the usual time can also be overrated, and even get a high score; "study hegemony" is never out of class, tasks, notes look good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
Thus, it appears that the students in Lanzhou reflect the problems in the university exams are not in vain, and believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I would like to congratulate the three students who wrote the letter straight.
In fact, people who have gone to the university are clear that the strike preparation for the exam, thinking of various ways from the teacher to "pick up" the examination issue, to struggle for the scope of the exam, to obtain "key counselling" before the exam is not a rare phenomenon, even in the exam with a copy, after the exam asking the teacher to raise a high hand is not a surprise.
In the opinion of the author, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, to measure the qualification of a university exam or not, is more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposal on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage of the university, the professional begins to segment, and many specialized courses are dominated by the basics.
Without a doubt, whether to comprehensively master the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university exam to be examined.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, but is basically fixed.
As some teachers say, “20 years ago, the basics of university mathematics were taught, and now they are still being taught, or focused.”
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not mean that the exam is single and the test is repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a task group, and then the senior teachers of the discipline will integrate the examination paper, and the examination paper will also be participated by all the teachers in the discipline, so that you can overcome the repetition of the test topic to a certain extent.
But to formulate a set of trial subjects that meet the practical teaching and learning, the subjects according to the student's overall learning situation, difficulty in presenting the normal distribution, also need to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the exam proposal is difficult, the subject type has a dynamic grasp, can both highlight the basic knowledge examination, but can also take into account the ability examination, at the same time for the subject type to innovate design.
The examination is the command bar of university education, and what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparatory examination program, which will affect the performance of university education.
For the student's recommendation letter, the Lanzhou University College attaches great importance, and the reform program has been deployed throughout the school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to conduct study and course-end examination and self-examination, formulate examination proposals and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination proposals and audit links, refine the evaluation of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of courses and teaching aspects.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of the single type of test topic, the repeat of the topic, etc. are the topics that the university examination needs to face, of course, the corresponding system needs to be introduced, but the skills are expensive in the daily life, teachers need to comprehensively master the teaching situation, not only to grasp the teaching content, but also to grasp the student's learning situation, both will be better matched, teaching and learning will form a good interaction, the examination will also be more in line with the reality, so that the "learning master" and "learning junk" get their place.
3,200 newborns without newspaper paper
The National Register of Saudi Arabia said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeit paper storage light, it was not possible to issue newspapers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and so far has accumulated 3,200 people affected.
However, the director of the agency, Kyle Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for newspapers, the information has been recorded in the system and will be replenished when the counterfeit paper is delivered next week.
At a news conference, he explained about a 10-month report on the issue of the printing of newspaper papers in Shaba.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago, and that Sarajevo was facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing specialized anti-false paper were affected by the epidemic, which caused delays in shipment to our country.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in the Saba newspaper paper is different from other regions, and therefore it is not possible to borrow stock from other states.
Kerou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has been shipped to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month, and subsequently delivered to the printing company on 8th for partial printing work.
"The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Saba immediately for the final stage of printing, an estimated two more working days (20 December) can be delivered to the applicant's hands."
“We will notify applicants to go to branches around the world to receive newspapers.”
He added that Saudi Arabia has issued a total of 24,801 newspapers so far this year.

48-hour nuclear acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The Joint Defense Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a request to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control.
The Joint Defense Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of new coronavirus epidemics in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the port city (except for those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a 48-hour nuclear acid detection negative certificate, and to carry out at least one nuclear acid testing after arrival of personnel from the border port city.
According to the notice, the timeframe for the above requirements is from the date of determination of the port city scope and announcement by the municipalities of each province to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditioned port cities can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffering zones within the jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border trade is the local major economic pillar, and frequent exchanges between border citizens between the two sides.
The implementation of the differentiation management policy, from one prevention and outflow defense line to two lines of defense, is expected to the threshold of advance, compress the outflow risk of the epidemic, with the least social impact and the lowest social cost to the maximum outcome of the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Recently, there have been many domestic aggregate epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.

According to the notification, the port cities referred to include open land, waterways, air ports in the county (city, district, flag), the city (city, state, union) and the municipality directly under the jurisdiction, the specific scope of which is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the jurisdiction) according to the need for epidemic prevention and control and timely announcement.
The truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the U.S. military.
(Source of the video: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called The Killing Machine attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the U.S. launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", exporting American-style democracy through warfare, 20 years of poor soldiers worshiping, bloody sex, murdering innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones to airstrike hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity, and set up killing groups.
In the past 20 years, U.S. troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has set up a “black jail” for torture and personal humiliation of the “suspects.”
A crime against humanity has sparked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terror” war is “against terror.”
The war did not bring peace and democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, it brought only a country full of acne and countless killings and destruction.
Let us uncover the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States under the name of “anti-terrorism” and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Do not scare people at the starting line.
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful school books.
Today’s successful learning books, many of which are promoted as “best principles” — that is, first assume or imply that you can “do” and then tell you “what” you need to do.
It is equivalent to say that at once we have crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
That’s why all these books have one common feature—either do the best you can, or just do nothing; either 100 or 0; or you climb the mountain, or you just stay there.
This “best principle” is recognized by anyone, but 99% of people are scared before the starting line.
Because this theory is advocated as a path of "you have to be determined, re-be a person, to a 180-degree big change", and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For the person who keeps the rules, because of the old, refuses to change, you prefer to shout in his ear "you want to change", undoubtedly self-deceiving, to the bull piano.
The vast majority of people will be frightened in front of the two words "transformation", cluttered, difficult to resolve; or by momentary impulses hurt the determination of "transformation", and brave take the first step, but often the good prospect is not long, can not persist for a while to lose the line, difficult to see continuity.
The famous “From Tomorrow Starting” of Mr. Ma Smithi is the most divinely expressed classic of this “universal humanity.”
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of the ability of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door".
Per, the “best second” principle is a way to get more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the “best second” principle lies in “lowering the threshold” — it encourages a “small win for big win” theory that if you don’t do 100 you can only do 1: because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you can’t climb the Thai mountain, you can only climb the small sand hill at your doorstep, because it’s always step faster than the original one.
Anyway, as long as you do something, you are always stronger than not.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to do insistence, and the chances of success will increase if everything is insisted.
Only following the success of the "best second" principle, the path is a little longer.
In summary, the “best principle” despite the appearance of the banner that makes everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire, in fact, a few; and the “best principle” can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many as possible.

The common name of Qingdao Lake is "crabfish", a precious fish species that is unique to the Qingdao Lake, and has a significant role inining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qingdao Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the increasing degradation of the environment in the waters of human killing and naked naked reproduction, the number of naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked nak
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of Species listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai province has implemented a ban on lake-fishing, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals to go to the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and lakes, and prohibiting the sale of nude fish and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial proliferation release and cleaning of Qinghai Lakes mainly into the lake river riverway, the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageway" continued to increase protection efforts, and Qinghai Lake naked resource holdings increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy head of the agricultural and rural department of Qinghai Province, introduced that so far, Qinghai Lake Nude has cumulatively implemented artificial proliferation release of 1,8 million tails, and the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake Nude Resources is more than 23%.
Qingdao is an important ecological barrier and water resource coverage area in China and even Asia, while Qingdao Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sichuan River and Qinghai Lake waters, protect the aquatic wildlife, and safeguard the biodiversity of the Qinghai Highlands, Qinghai Sea has since released a notice of prohibition on the capture of key waters in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive capture ban management system.

Friends who like meteor rain can observe in the last few hours after the late moon, but pay attention to the cold and warm."
How can we observe as many meteorites as possible?

It should be noted that the flow of Gemini meteor rain in all directions is large, and you do not need to constantly look at the radiation of Gemini meteor rain when observing.
Friends who like photography to want to shoot gorgeous 'Meteor rain large parts', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-spectrum lens, use high ISO and maximum spectrum when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries and fast door lines are also essential.”
