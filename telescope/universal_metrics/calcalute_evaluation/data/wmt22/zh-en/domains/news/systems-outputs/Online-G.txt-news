The research results of students singing the protagonist at the Academic annual Meeting of Zhejiang University opened people's minds-Xinhua
Use the air to wash your hands, take a breath to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. Their research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
“You only need to take a gentle breath, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale.  ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smart phone, and after the gas is exhaled, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new type of material, graphene. Its target is a chemical element. Its keen “sense of smell” allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamp: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“Many diseases are not detected early and resection is not in place. It is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.  ”
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early stage of cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four light panels, which can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of smart surgical lamp has been trialled in Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer at most, while Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of ”air hand washing devices."
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
“It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!  ”
Experiments on color rendering reaction and bacterial residues have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Chongqing Vocational School pilot modern apprenticeship system admission is a prospective employee of the enterprise-Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship system” talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After the enrollment is entered, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and engineering procedures for enterprises be standardized, and the dual identities of students in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises for apprentices be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and have not reached the age of 18, the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises must sign agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests of apprentices for on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for corporate employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In the practice of enterprises, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotating training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each with a number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) have been trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing it, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education of schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of their counterparts.
The China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to allow children to ”celebrate“ June 1st” with high-tech"-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi, Zhou Shanshan) Reporters learned from the China Children's Center on the 20th that the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as children's maker experience, children's Visual Art Festival, and parent-child book carnival before and after Children's Day from May 28 to June 1st, so that children can spend “June 1st” in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
It is understood that the activities held by the China Children's Center during the “Children's Day” this year include the ”Aijia Chuangku" Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Visual Art Festival, the ”Book Carnival“ activities, and the ”Family Loves Reading" picture book series activities.
Li Zhongming, deputy Director of the China Children's Center, introduced at the 2016 “Children's Day” Media briefing held on the 20th that the “Aijia Chuangku” Children's Future Learning Carnival is the key event of the China Children's Center to celebrate “Children's Day” this year.
The activities focus on the organic combination of social innovation and family personal creativity, through the participation of children and families to experience various innovative educational activities, so that innovative practice can become the cultural gene of the public family, and “hands-on” can become the new learning and lifestyle of the majority of families.
It is reported that the ”Aijia Chuangku" children's future learning Carnival includes dozens of cutting-edge technology experience content such as the ”Douguo Maker“ experience event, the anniversary celebration of the Lao Niu Children's Discovery Museum and the ”Exploring the Family's Love of Children's Cute Children's Day“ event, the VR National Experience Program, and the ”Maker Tribe" Interactive Workshop.
South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omik is strong, it is mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the illness caused by the Omicron variant of the new crown virus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, an organization of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have relatively mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough. Flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients have yet needed to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation.  ”
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to fall into severe illness due to Coronavirus infection.
He said that in contrast, in the last wave of the Delta epidemic, the new crown patients he treated “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases: Among the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% are seriously ill, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent new crown patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak of cases in South Africa, the proportion of deaths reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease.  ”
He also said: “It's still early days, and we need to obtain late-stage data.
Under normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only entered this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.  ”
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new crown virus strain in the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
According to health officials, Gauteng Province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If it is analogous to the famous public service slogan “There is no killing without buying and selling”, then in a good environment where there is no need for “abduction”, group prevention and group governance, and the whole people's anti-abduction will make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Kidnapping Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion”, I feel full of warmth.
The new technology means are not only full of “literature and art” and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many “big words”.
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is resolved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Matters are prioritized. Under the urgent purpose of “seeking rescue”, controversial topics such as “Whether child abduction and trafficking should be subject to the death penalty” can be postponed for a while and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience in the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the place of the crime as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction-seeking operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the “reunion” platform that directly helps to solve the case and find the child.
After all, “fighting abduction” is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of law, all need to implement the care of “protecting young children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and their parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that their children were gone.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's "Criminal Law", the legal starting point for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be punishable by death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of ”light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier penalties.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising their children.
The legal education of these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking in human beings, strict official law enforcement cannot be relied on alone.
If the “market” for abduction collection is widespread, and the traffickers are eager to innovate their methods of abduction and trafficking, forming a “fighting method” situation with law enforcement, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing common sense of the law will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The democracy summit ended, Biden said the fire of freedom will never go out
The online “Summit for Democracy” convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments of 110 countries around the world, as well as leaders of civil society and the private sector, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global “Democracy Summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and a member of the Government Affairs Committee, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the flame of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world.  ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the buffering and shock forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.  ”
The themes of the second day of the ”Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with ”International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reiterate common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.  ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong delivered a speech to the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the (resources) we have to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority.  ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat (the CCP) poses to our democratic values.
And this is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.  ”
Tang Feng, a member of the Administrative Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, attended the round-table discussion on “Combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values” and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have also played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to take it off the shelves to defeat fake information.  ”
At the same time as the second day of the ”Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that have been found to have seriously violated human rights in accordance with the law, and at the same time imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The girl used the target as a target to raise funds for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh wound"-Xinhua
A girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, stood in front of a large wooden board with the words “Human target, ten yuan per arrow” written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of “Hangzhou girl willing to be a ‘target'to raise money for her sister” maxed out the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a human. The words “Human target, ten yuan per arrow” are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move after raising money for her sister, but this behavior was not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "archery target" fundraising was warned
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of ”a“. The words ”Human target, ten yuan per arrow" are written in black ink on the wooden board. Her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts are written on another wooden board in front of her.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this move was a “beggar's begging behavior”, and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
“We discovered the situation when we patrolled to the side of the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. There were already a lot of onlookers at that time.  ”
The police at the Tianshui police station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up as young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was the “human target” kept crying, begging passers-by to play this game; the other girl yelled for help on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.  ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still costs more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn't think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found to shoot arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, “This kind of fundraising method is not advocated.”
After being warned by the police at the police station, she had already left the police station.
Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve"-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival, the national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
A variety of full-reduced red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the ”Double Twelve“, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ”Jiexin") issued a rational consumption initiative to remind the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer Financial Literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, our residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but they show greater differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and they need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and “one old and one young” will continue to be the focus of financial education; the “Debt Status Report of Young People in China” released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance and Economics show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive profligacy" label labeled by the outside world, some young people do. There is excessive consumption and consumption behavior that follows the trend, and as a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have been generated, and even social problems have gradually increased. Financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiexin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to take practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
In the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups, including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic colleges and universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms, it has imperceptibly guided the consumption needs of young groups rationally, helped them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally planned consumption needs, and then helped them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer borrowing misunderstandings so as not to affect personal credit reporting and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and do your best to repay on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic life such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Jiexin will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more suitable needs and diversified services, and continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer's lifelong and reliable consumer finance partner.
Vietnam People's Daily-Gulf Cooperation Council Addresses Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “unity and stability”.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab countries' efforts to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar come from the requirement that they must unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and aim to meet common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate their supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US55 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandum of understanding on cooperation worth US330 billion.
The visit of the Saudi crown prince to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to save the Iranian nuclear agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—an agreement condemned by Gulf Arab countries because they believe it cannot solve the missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and at the same time propose various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school philosophy and value pursuits that have been accumulated for a long time in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our university, it emerged in the autumn of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in the times. It advocates the value concept of “Mingde Ji Shi, cultivating Qi and governing peace” and the patriotic responsibility of “Xingxue Powerhouse”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and talent is constantly intensifying. As an important “supply side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan to promote the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines in a Comprehensive Manner" demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to be among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, so as to achieve “curve overtaking”?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of later development, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, gather consensus and work together to optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid foundation for schools to accelerate their catch-up with the world's advanced level guarantee.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools. While giving full play to their advantages, each school must demonstrate its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: first, we highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated educational environment for the integration of science and education, school-enterprise integration, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the subject system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of ”Seeking truth and innovation“, the common values of ”diligence, cultivation of virtue, discernment, and faithfulness“, and ”Haina Jianghe, enlightenment and virtue, enlightenment of the people, and the state of our country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, continuously accumulate a high degree of culture and condense spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, “Haina Jianghe” emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the mind of “the talents of the world are for my use”, and manifests itself as drawing on the high-quality concept of educating people in prestigious schools around the world; “Enlightenment and virtue” emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and perfection, which refers to the university's pursuit of the truth. At the same time, it should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality; “Kaiwu Qianmin” embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the innovation of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself as reform and development, revolution and innovation; “Tree my country” emphasizes The spirit of patriotism and dedication is that the university should always share glory and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
“The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the unformed."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the national spirit can agitate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions to 3 Ivy League schools such as Yale-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian—American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools—Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College-discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious schools in the United States has increased exponentially, but in these three prestigious schools in the United States, the proportion of Asian Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities “continuously and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants for a long time” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that research by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in these three universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups participating in the appeal, they also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, tool and weapon democracy, and act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video. Leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticizing the invited participants, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration's true intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Schultz also participated in the video democracy Summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, and the division between rich and poor are intensifying." Democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in his speech, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the power of authoritarian buffers and shocks, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.  "
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time.  "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."
The United States has promised that after this democracy summit, it will launch a one-year operation, including a US倡议424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Physical democracy Summit scheduled to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Educational thinking: How to make “Xueba” and “Xueba” have their own place in university exams-Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination and change the question types of the examination so that the examination truly reflects the actual level of the students' demands.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a “hot topic”.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, coupled with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
For the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there are different feelings.
Of course, if the exam question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who don't need to work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If you think of other methods, it is possible to achieve a multiplier effect with half the effort.
In this way, there has been a “strange status quo” that “Xueba” can pass the exam without investment, and even get a high score; “Xueba” usually never leaves class, homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher.
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in the university examination are not for no reason, and I believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote straightforwardly.
In fact, people who have been to university know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam unannounced, think of various ways to “get” the exam questions from the teacher, strive to narrow the scope of the exam, and obtain “key guidance” before the exam. It is not uncommon to even entrain a cheat sheet in the exam and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam. It is not an anecdote.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation guide, measuring the passability of a university examination lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage of the university, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject. From the point of view of knowledge, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, “I studied the basic knowledge of mathematics in college 20 years ago, but I am still studying it now, and it is still the focus.  ”
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the test question type is single or the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams generally form a question group, and then senior teachers in the subject co-ordinate the composition of the test papers. The examination papers are also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent. The situation.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning. The questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question types, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams are there, students will have corresponding exam preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the students' letter of suggestion, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination of course completion exams, formulate exam paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of exam paper propositions and review links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanically solving the problems of single types of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that universities need to face in the examination affairs. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but effort is expensive in daily life and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is necessary not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student's learning situation. Both ends will be thoroughly fed. Teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a healthy interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that “Xueba” and “Xueba” have their own place.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not report birth papers due to special anti-counterfeiting paper out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October. So far, the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers have their information recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month-old report by an online media that Sabah newspaper had a printing problem.
He said that the relevant problem appeared two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, which has caused delays in shipping to our country.  ”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kairouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for part of the printing work.
“The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20).  ”
“We will notify applicants to go to various branches to collect the application papers.  ”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 student papers so far this year.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone”, the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint defense and control mechanism of the State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring persons who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test certificate, and those who go to land border port cities will undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, regions and cities determine the scope of the port city and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions can study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a zoning and differentiated management policy has changed from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense. It is expected to move the threshold forward, compress the risk of spillovers from the epidemic, and achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this has exposed problems such as untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places, inadequate closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, the flow of regular nucleic acid testing, the failure of all links of cold chain items to be eliminated, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the emergency response to the epidemic is not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of port cities' prevention and control, and to do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against foreign imports.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the supply of basic living materials, prices and other hidden dangers, and promptly solve and proactively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the counties (cities, districts, and flags) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, and unions) where they are located, and the municipalities directly under the Central Government. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and shall be announced in a timely manner.
The truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military in the tubing video-Xinhua
(Video source: tubing)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the tubing platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of “counter-terrorism” and forcibly exporting American democracy through the war. For 20 years, it has been militaristic, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Indiscriminate drone strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distort human nature, and set up murderous groups.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison” to torture and physically humiliate "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American “war on terrorism” is “more anti-terrorism and more terrorist.”
The war did not bring peace, democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people. All it brought was a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let us come together to expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of “counter-terrorism” in the United States, and expose the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhua
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful academic books.
Many of today's success books promote the “best principle”—that is, first assume or imply that you can “do it”, and then tell you what you need to do “what”.
It is tantamount to saying that the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it” has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature—either just do your best with a bang, or just don't do anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This kind of “best principle”, anyone who looks at it will admit that it is “extremely correct”, but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you have to make up your mind, become a new person, and have a 180-degree transformation”, and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the rules, and refuse to change, you have to shout “You want to change” in his ear. It is undoubtedly a move to deceive yourself and play the piano to the cow.
Most people will be timid before the “transformation” two days, hesitant, and difficult to make up their minds; or they have made up their minds to “transform” with a momentary impulse, and bravely took the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they will be defeated if they don't hold on for a long time, and it is difficult to see continuity.
The famous cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli's "Starting from Tomorrow“ is the most expressive expression of this ”universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people “look at the door and sigh.”
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on the road to relative success.
The core of the “second—best principle” lies in “lowering the threshold”—it encourages a theory of “accumulating small victories for big victories”, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Since the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the “second-best principle” is slightly longer.
All in all, although the ”best principle“ is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, there are actually a few that it can ultimately motivate; and the ”second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
The common name of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake is "Huangyu". It is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as man-made mass killing and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and drainage, the cleaning of the main rivers and rivers entering Qinghai Lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable “fish passage”, protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million koi in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferated and released, and the contribution rate to the restoration of koi resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in my country and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of “one river, one river and one lake”.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first case of infection with the Omicron strain-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th, Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new crown mutant virus.
Mauritius reported two cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
All three of them are students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. They were not admitted to the hospital for treatment because they were all mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik virus, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer New Crown vaccine.

There is an appointment in the starry sky 丨 The Gemini meteor shower ushered in a great day on the 14th-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern hemisphere, will usher in a great day on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
The Gemini meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200-year-old asteroid Faer, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not “conceived” by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like New Year blockbusters, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the “release schedule” can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Together with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseus meteor Shower, it is called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, rich in colors, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners to shoot.
The Gemini meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will usher in a great time around 15:00 on December 14th. At the extreme time, ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is directly above the head of the sky, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) is 150.
Gemini Meteor shower recommended index chart.
“Last year, the Gemini meteor shower of "Falling in the Sky" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a little.
The 14th is the 11th of November of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is the full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but pay attention to keeping warm from the cold.  ”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets. Visual observation can be done.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous ‘meteor shower blockbusters’, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential.  ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
Vietnam People's Daily-Vietnamese Government Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
