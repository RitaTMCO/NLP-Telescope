Students sing the lead role at ZJU's annual academic conference Research results make people's brains explode - Xinhua
Washing hands with air, taking a breath to determine disease, and searching precisely for the source of haze A series of brainy academic achievements were honored at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Annual Academic Conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science, humanities and education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-end biosensor on site, half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to gently exhale, this set of instruments can be from the composition of your exhaled gas, the initial detection of physical health . "
Zhang Diming said that the set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions, generally detect the temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optical Science and Engineering, opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases early detection and removal are not in place, related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room . "
Shen Junfei said, for example, when the early examination of cancer, if the doctor can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs, which enhance the degree of differentiation of different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadow-free rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received better feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of National Challenge Cup.
Hand washing with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the device's hand washing station, our weight will be able to compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air, at the faucet to form a fluid, and water combined together.
Thus, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as the ordinary hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, both to ensure the degree of washing, but also to save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools.

South African doctors: Omicron spreads strongly but is mostly a mild disease
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new coronavirus Omicron variant causes milder disease than the Delta variant, although the spread is faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 physicians in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the New Guinea patients they are currently treating are showing milder symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
The group's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have yet required hospitalization.
They are able to manage the disease at home, and most recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. "
That includes older patients and those with health problems that would have been more susceptible to serious illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
By contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many had to be hospitalized within days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several more weeks to collect sufficient data, physicians' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases: only 30 % of newly crowned patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3 % of recent newly crowned patients died, compared with 20 % of deaths in earlier outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease. "
He added: "It's still early days, and we need to get late data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this outbreak. "
In the meantime, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 % increase in new cases identified in the first week of December, and tests show that the Omicron variant accounts for more than 90% of cases.
Education Commentary: What does it take to save an abducted child?
If the famous public service announcement "No sale, no kill" is an analogy, then in a good environment without the need to "collect abduction", group prevention and anti-trafficking, so that the abduction is not profitable, risky and costly, this type of crime will not repeatedly occur. The actual fact is that the actual fact is that the particulars of the actuals are not the same as the actuals of the actuals.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Office of the fight against trafficking in children developed the emergency release platform for missing children information online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing child information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the app is called "Reunion", I felt a warm feeling.
The new technology means not only the name "literary", full of emotion, and the proper use of information technology, practical, effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
But before the case of trafficking is solved, the priority should be to focus on the personal safety of the victim.
The matter is divided into priorities, in the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be all death penalty" and other controversial topics, can be set aside, cautious discussion; but the rescue of abducted children can not wait.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to get away from the place of crime as soon as possible after getting their hands on them.
The search for the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one.
In this case, come up with such as "reunion" platform directly help to solve the case, to find the child effective way, is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the judicial protection, as well as the meticulous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the "protection of the young and the weak" care.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can do better.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting in a train station, the parents asleep, only to wake up to find the child missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as the parents of a young child, should have at least a fair sense of protection.
The two parents take turns to rest, or put the child under secure protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police fight against the crime of abduction, the party who buys the abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and sale starts at five years; in particularly serious cases, up to the death penalty, and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high, the maximum penalty is heavy, in the general trend of "lightening", the crime of child abduction and sale is obviously a heavier punishment of crime.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking occurring every year.
This shows that some people are backward in the concept of raising children and have little legal awareness.
The legal education for this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely only on strict official law enforcement.
If the abduction "market" is widespread, the traffickers lust for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, the formation of "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the anti-trafficking action is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, to break the backward concept, the popularization of common sense laws, but also to help eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Flames of Freedom Never Go Out
The online "Summit for Democracy" ( Summit for Democracy), convened by President Joe Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, came to an end Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and can never be extinguished by authoritarian regimes.
He also said he plans to hold a second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan's government representative, Councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwun-chung, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I've said before, as this summit shows, democracy is everywhere in the world.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the concerted efforts of the entire community.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the parapets of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good . "
"The second day of the Democracy Summit was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
The day coincided with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially from emerging digital technologies.
It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires firmly condemning all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. "
In a pre-recorded video address to the summit, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun Chung reminded participants of the ongoing concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and for China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the Chinese Communist threat.
Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [the CCP] poses to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we're failing.
And that's why we have to change . "
In a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Councilor Tang Feng issued a national statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is still in its infancy, we have always been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we don't have to seal off the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat disinformation. "
As the second day of the Democracy Summit got underway, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses.

Jetson advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival reached a record high of 1.77 trillion yuan in national online payment transactions compared to previous years.
On the one hand, people sighed at the increasingly strong national consumption power, and on the other hand, they had to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on the society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", Gitzo Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Gitzo") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blindly consume and over-consume.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, China's residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but reflect greater variability in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Youth Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation shows an overall trend of rational consumption, although it is very different from the label of "excessive spending", some young people do have excessive consumption, follow the trend of consumption behavior, and therefore This has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and has even led to an increase in social problems, so financial companies should be brave enough to assume social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
Over the past years, Gitzo has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has been working with top universities in China to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to guide young people's consumption needs, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts and plan their consumption needs rationally, thus helping them to accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the 12th of February, Gitzo reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and over-consumption, and avoid the misconceptions of consumption and borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
It is important to plan ahead when spending and pay back on time according to your ability.
If you are overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may adversely affect your economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Gitzo will continue to bring more tailored and diversified services to consumers with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and being consumers' lifelong trusted consumer finance partner.
Vietnam People's Daily Online - GCC tackles common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on the country in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in both countries.
The Gulf Arab states are resolving their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long link between the two countries will facilitate travel and integrate supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have denounced as failing to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a longtime "competitor" and see its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
It is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures that will allow its member states to cooperate fully to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

How to be among the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time and speed up the establishment of several world class universities and a number of world class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap to achieve "overtaking"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should also give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, the advantage of latecomers, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in 5,000 years and promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to coalesce The third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the system of the socialist country, strengthening the goal-driven, gathering consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The characteristics of the school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of characteristics: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of training innovative and entrepreneurial talents, constructing an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education, school and enterprise, and forming a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary crossover, and actively cultivating crossover emerging disciplines and landmark crossover achievements Third, it highlights the characteristics of school system and social services, carries out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerates the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University's industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with each other.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking the truth and innovation", the common values of "diligent learning, cultivating virtue, discernment and practicality" and the motto of "Accepting the rivers, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening up things before the people, and making our country a nation" together constitute the spirit of Zhejiang University. "Together, they constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of school running, accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching.
Among them, the "sea of rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and expresses the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qizhen Houde " emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, the university should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality; " open up the things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as the reform and development, and the reform of the old and the new. The spirit of patriotism and dedication is emphasized in "Make our country a better place", which means that the university should always share the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual philosophy and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation.
"The intelligent person hears in silence, and the wise person sees in the unformed " .
Chinese universities should further base on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, they should adhere to the humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit can stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power to achieve national prosperity and national revitalization and realize the common ideal of human beings.

Asian American group complains about discrimination in admissions at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- for discriminating against Asian American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington, D.C., the same day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to top U.S. schools has grown exponentially, but the percentage of Asians at the three top U.S. schools has remained at essentially the same level, said the group's president, Yuh-Kong Cho, at the conference.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "systematically discriminate against Asian applicants over time" in a so-called "holistic" admissions process.
A 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that the three colleges had the lowest acceptance rates for Asians among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants, according to Yuke Zhao.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and that Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicant students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting their complaints, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to stop these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the facts are determined.
They also hope that the colleges and universities under complaint can take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change their admissions policies for Asians.
The three colleges and universities that have been the subject of the complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition, founded in 2015, had complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination at that time, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
This time, in addition to Chinese American groups involved in the complaint, it also includes Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.
（After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Saturday (Dec. 11) that the United States had organized the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, use democracy as a pretext to fight against democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' with disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for U.S. intervention in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and 111 leaders from around the world were invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the United States for its own faulty democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
There was also skepticism internationally and within the United States, such as criticism that the invitees included leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and suspicion that the Biden administration's true intentions were not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing the summit.
German Chancellor Scholz, who just took office, also attended the video democracy summit
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social cleavages, racial tensions, and the division between rich and poor becoming more and more acute" and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
President Joe Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good. "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted , " we must renew it in each generation, which, in my opinion, is the defining challenge of our time . "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuing and troubling challenges.
For its part, the U.S. pledged to follow up the Democracy Summit with a year-long initiative that includes $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States expects countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democracies before the physical Democracy Summit, scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said , " Let's all countries follow through on our commitments and report next year on the progress we've made " .
Education thinking: how to make the university exams " " " academic dregs " each in their place - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exams, and raising the difficulty of the exams, changing the type of exam questions, so that the exams really reflect the actual level of students' demands.
Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of study, their learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that the assessment of such a diverse group of people will have different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the blitz before the exam, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, there is a "dregs" usually do not put in can also pass, and even scored high; " school bully" usually never drop class, homework, notes are good, the test is not much higher than the "strange status quo " .
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University do not reflect the problems in the university examinations for no reason, and I believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who have written letters to express their views.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware of the phenomenon of surprise preparations, trying to find various ways to "get" exam questions from teachers, to get the scope of the examination, to get "key tutoring" before the examination is not uncommon, and even in the examination with a cheat sheet, after the examination to beg the teacher to lift the hand The situation is not uncommon.
In the author's opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guide, the measure of a university examination is more on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific questions based on this.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in university examinations.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the subject, in terms of knowledge, there is not much room for change, basically fixed.
As a teacher said , " 20 years ago to learn the basic knowledge of college mathematics, and now still learning, or focus . "
But just because the knowledge is basically the same, it doesn't mean that there is a single type of test question or a repetition of test questions.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of question groups, and then senior teachers in the subject coordinate the composition of the test paper, and the exam is also marked by all teachers who undertake the subject to participate, so that to a certain extent to overcome the repetition of test questions.
However, in order to develop a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are normally distributed in terms of difficulty and ease according to the overall situation of students' learning.
The examination is the baton of university education. With the kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation program, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Regarding the students' suggestion letter, the university of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a plan to rectify the situation in the whole university.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination against the end-of-course examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of a single type of test questions, repetitive questions and other issues is the university examination needs to face the issue, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the work is valuable in the daily, need teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also must eat through the student learning situation, both ends eat through, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of a positive interaction, the examination will be more in line with the actual, so that The "school bully" and "school dregs" each have their own place.

Oil tube video bottoming out the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. military - Xinhua
(Video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the Oil Pipe platform attracted widespread attention.

In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has set up "black prisons" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
The crimes against humanity have stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the U.S.-style "war on terror" is "getting worse and worse.
Instead of bringing peace and democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, the war has brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the fire of success books.
Today's success books, many of them promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do", and then tell you need to do things "What it is".
That is to say, it is the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it" that has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either you do the best you can, or simply do nothing; either is 100, or is 0; either you will climb the mountain, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle", let anyone look at it will admit that "the right incomparable", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make up your mind, do it again, a 180-degree transformation" path, which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For people who are stuck in the old ways, who refuse to change, you have to shout "you have to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-defeating, playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "change" cowardly, stagnant, difficult to make up their mind; or with the impulse of the moment painful "change" of the determination, and bravely take the first step, but often is not long, do not last much longer to It is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic strip "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it is often beyond the limits of ordinary people's ability, so that the majority of people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way to let more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the bar" - it encourages a theory of "small wins make big wins". The theory that if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the sand dune in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold is significantly lowered, so there are more possibilities for ordinary people to do persistence, and everything as long as persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
Only follow the "second best principle" of the road to success, the journey is slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" on the surface of the banner to let everyone succeed, but it can ultimately motivate, in fact, a few; and the "second best principle" to effectively motivate more people, as many people as possible to benefit.
