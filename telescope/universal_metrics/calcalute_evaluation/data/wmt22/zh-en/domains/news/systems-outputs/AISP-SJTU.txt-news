At the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, the research results of students playing the leading role make people's brains open-Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family medical examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health from the gas composition you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling air.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen sense of smell enables it to reflect the health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating lamp: doctors' high-energy eyes
Besides smart phones, smart operating lamps are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented intelligent LED shadowless lamps for surgery.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent operating lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the difference between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of light spots at any time according to the needs of operation and personal habits.
This intelligent operating lamp has been tried in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! "
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to be driven by our own gravity, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing secondary vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is an enterprise prospective employee-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, Standardize the enrollment procedures of secondary vocational schools and employment procedures of enterprises, Clarify the dual identities of apprentices in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises, According to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises must sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific posts, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentices on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship and cooperative enterprises to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design personnel training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional personnel training plan, and the internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can take 2 ~ 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required by each rotation training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot projects of modern apprenticeship in municipal secondary vocational schools in three batches, with the number of each pilot project being about 50, and training about 3,000 students (apprentices) in total.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, it is mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the Novel Coronavirus Omicron variant is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of Omicron variant in South Africa, a physician organization composed of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the group, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet.
"They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
He said that includes older patients and those with health problems, people who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. ".
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant strain was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although gathering enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, which is half of the severe proportion of the previous epidemic; The average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa died.
"At the moment, almost all the indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He also said: "It is still early, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we are only two weeks into this wave of outbreaks. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the leading Novel Coronavirus strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng province saw a 400% increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, according to health officials, and tests showed the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Education Review: What Should We Rely on to Save Abducted Children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan "No sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "collecting and abducting", mass prevention and treatment, and anti-abduction by the whole people make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and find abducted children in time.
Hearing that this App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technical means are not only named "literature and art", but also full of feelings, and the informationization is used properly, practically and effectively.
The primary goal of law enforcement against abduction is to find abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Prioritize things. Under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be subject to death" can be temporarily put aside and discussed carefully; But the rescue of abducted children can't wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way such as "reunion" platform, which is directly helpful to solve cases and find children.
After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the whole legal system.
To crack down on crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the guarantee of justice and the meticulous law enforcement, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the railway station, and their parents slept soundly, only to wake up to find that their children were gone.
A two-year-old child can't be expected to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, which are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the starting point of legal punishment in crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscated of property.
Under the general trend of "light punishment", crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
The legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we can't rely solely on the strict enforcement of the law by the government.
If the "market" of abduction exists widely, the traffickers are greedy for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, and form a situation of "fighting against the law" with law enforcers, and the anti-abduction action is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The democracy summit ended, and Biden said that the fire of freedom will never go out
The online "Summit for Democracy", convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and an administrative councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the slight fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including using all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation in Hong Kong and ethnic Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to make sure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary 　, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat [CPC] poses to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, an administrative councilor of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan Province, attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values" and released a "National Statement" by video, emphasizing that Taiwan Province stands at the forefront of confronting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan Province, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can overcome false information without taking it off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have seriously violated human rights, and at the same time impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh injury"-Xinhuanet
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girls are willing to be'arrow targets' to raise money for their sisters" blew up the circle of friends.
Photographs show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than people in Wulin Square, Hangzhou. The words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
This behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of propaganda of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive move only after collecting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "arrow target" fundraising was warned
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account number, WeChat account number and Alipay account number are written on another wooden board in front of her.
This picture caused controversy after surfing the Internet.
Some netizens think that this move is an "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 am on the 23 rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, Tianshui Police Station near the incident said that there were two girls who set up stalls, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed beautifully.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl shouted at the edge, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, and now she is in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of propaganda of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl named Ji Jiali raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, I can't think of a good way to raise money, so I made this behavior.
He said that in the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for helping, but she did not participate in it. No archery was found in the whole process, but someone watched and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated".
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.
Gitzo advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelfth"-Economic Observation Network-Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
A wide variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger and stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelfth", Gitzo Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Gitzo") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Survey and Analysis Report on Consumer Financial Literacy released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education; According to the Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Youth released by Nielsen and the Report on the Consumption of Chinese Youth 2019-2020 released by CCTV Finance, The younger generation has great consumption potential, Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, Nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, Although the younger generation presents a rational consumption trend as a whole, Although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" labeled by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, which leads to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even leads to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave enough to assume social responsibility and give positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, actively responding to the call of supervision, and taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Gitzo continues to carry out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including college students. And through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms, we can subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of the Double Twelfth, Gitzo reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When spending, we must plan ahead and repay on time according to our ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Gitzo will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products. Bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, constantly help the public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be reliable consumer financial partners for consumers all their lives.
Vietnam People's Daily Network-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a blanket embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors there.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which stems from the requirement of unity for the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long passage connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US $5 billion in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth US $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with talks between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA)-a deal condemned by Gulf Arab states for believing it could not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Under the background that the nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of its kind among GCC countries since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time propose measures to make its member States cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the spirit of university resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running ideas and value pursuits accumulated in the long-term development process of a university, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is very important to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, Universities shoulder a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they rise in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "helping the world by virtue, repairing Qi and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "developing learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines as a Whole" not only shows China's confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of backwardness, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and school quality can be significantly improved; The second is cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brand and enhance image; Third, institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running a school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talents training, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and combining schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and symbolic interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the characteristics of school-running system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University's industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always stick to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovating", the common values of "Diligence, Xiu De, Distinguishing and Being Honest", and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit are composed of "Heiner River, Enlightening Truth and Virtue, Opening Things Before People, and Building Our Country".
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the mind of "the world's talents are used by me", which is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people in world famous schools; "Kai Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the challenge of personality while pursuing truth; "Opening things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also the reform and development, innovation and innovation; "Building Our Country" emphasizes patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"Those who are wise listen to silence, while those who are wise see invisible".
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the era position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should stick to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit stir with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing inexhaustible motive force for realizing national prosperity and national rejuvenation and realizing the common ideal of mankind.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment of three Ivy League schools such as Yale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the discrimination of Asian applicants by three Ivy League schools-Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College in the enrollment process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which took the lead in initiating the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "discriminate against Asian applicants for a long time and systematically" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission ratio for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change the enrollment policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's enrollment, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani Americans also participated in the complaint.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw a line with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation and divert domestic contradictions".
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out'democratic transformation ', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated the'color revolution', resulting in disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promise.
The two-day conference, conducted by video, featured invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, for example, criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize this summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is morbid, with money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, polarization between the rich and the poor, etc.", and American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital, the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more able to resist the buffer and impact of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges".
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative that includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all our countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year.".
Educational thinking: How to make "Xueba" and "Xuezha" get their places in college examinations-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the college examination, and put forward the demands of improving the difficulty of the examination, changing the examination questions, and making the examination truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, college examinations have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and different learning levels.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may pass the exam by concentrated assault. If they think of other ways, they may get twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning slag" that can pass the customs without investment, and even get high scores; "Xueba" never leaves class at ordinary times, and his homework and notes are all good, and his exams are not much higher than the "strange status quo".
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in college examinations are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise these three students who wrote letters directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for exams by surprise, think of various ways to "take" exam questions from teachers, try to delimit the scope of exams, and get "key counseling" before exams. It is not an anecdote to even carry cheat sheets in exams and ask teachers to raise their hands after exams.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject in an all-round way is the content to be investigated in college examinations.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of disciplines. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, but it is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago, and I am still learning it, which is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination usually forms a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject make overall plans to form the examination paper, and all the teachers who undertake the subject participate in the examination marking, so as to overcome the repetition of the examination questions to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, According to the overall situation of students' learning, the difficulty of questions is normally distributed. It is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can dynamically grasp the difficulty and questions, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also give attention to the examination of ability, and at the same time carry out innovative design of questions.
Examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' advice letters, and has deployed rectification plans in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course final examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and examination links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination needs to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce a corresponding system, but Kung Fu is more important in daily life, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to thoroughly understand the teaching content, but also to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, so that teaching and learning will be better connected and form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "learning tyrants" and "learning scum" can get their places.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not report that raw paper was out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The National Registration Office of Sabah said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been impossible to issue raw paper to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.
However, Kailu Aminus, director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for the paper are recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained a report by an online media that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah newspaper had appeared for as long as 10 months.
He said that the relevant problems appeared two months ago, and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper paper is different from that in other regions, so it is impossible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant within 2 working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to collect the raw paper."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 papers so far this year.

According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing the policy of regional differentiation management, changing from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieve maximum results in epidemic prevention and control with minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as untimely monitoring and early warning of epidemic situation in some places, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid detection becoming a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain goods in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation places, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
According to the notice, efforts should be made from nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, so as to speed up the filling of shortcomings in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight defense line for external defense input.
The circular stressed that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work simultaneously, publish and unblock the hotline for people's livelihood security, regularly investigate the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the open land, waterway and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures and leagues) where they are located and the municipalities directly under the Central Government where they are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in time.
Oil pipeline video starts with the truth of bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years-Xinhuanet
(Video source: Tubing)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary named "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, being militaristic, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Abuse of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity and set up killing teams.
In the past 20 years, American troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to torture and humiliate the "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorism".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only the devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" before telling you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that "how to do it" is actually the most important and fundamental link.
For this reason, these books all have a common feature-either do the best in one go, or do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you will climb Mount Tai, or you will simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" will admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, turn over a new leaf, and make a great change of 180 degrees", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the old ways and refuse to change, you have to shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will make a fool of oneself in front of the word "change", and it is difficult to make up their minds; Or, with a temporary impulse, I made a painful determination to "change" and bravely took the first step, but it often didn't last long, and I couldn't persist for a while before I lost, so it was difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that vividly shows this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes most people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a possible way for more ordinary people to embark on the road of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because it is better than standing still.
In a word, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Because the threshold is greatly lowered, it is more possible for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
To sum up, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone succeed, what it can inspire in the end is actually a few; The "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people as much as possible.
The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Agriculture and Rural Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, which was more than 40 times higher than the initial protection period in 2002.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake dropped sharply due to factors such as mass hunting and degradation of the breeding water environment of naked carp. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to raise fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferated and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in western China.
In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan region and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wild animals and maintain the biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on fishing ban in key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

There are about the same Geminid meteor shower in the starry sky, which ushered in a great deal on the 14 th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower this year, Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14, and friends who like meteor shower can observe it in the middle of the night.
An Jiu, an astronomy enthusiast in Beijing, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is periodic comets, but the parent body of Geminid meteor shower is asteroid Phaeton No.3200, which is an Apollo asteroid.
Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, director of Tianjin Astronomical Society and expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like New Year's blockbusters, Geminid meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, and is called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere together with quadrant meteor shower and Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of Geminid meteor shower is that meteoroids are slow, colorful and have many fireball, which is suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14th, and the ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Recommended index map of Geminid meteor shower.
"Last year, people were deeply impressed by the colorful Geminid meteor shower, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the wonderful degree will be discounted a little.
14th is November 11th of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is full and convex. Bright moonlight will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of Geminid meteor shower will rise higher at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the last few hours when the moon falls behind in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold and warmth. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place with high altitude, little light damage and wide field of vision facing northeast in suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets for visual observation.
It should be noted that the flow of Geminid meteor shower in all directions is very large, so it is not necessary to stare at the radiation point of Geminid meteor shower all the time during observation.
Friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous meteor shower movies, it is best to choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity, tripods, backup batteries and cable release are also essential. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
