Students sing the leading role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, and the research results make the human brain open - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with open brains were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your home physician.
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smartphone side, which is half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang said the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, which targets chemical elements, and its keen sense of smell allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: Doctor's High-Energy Eyes.
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas amid the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and excision of many diseases is not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
For example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later, Shen said.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates, which adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: Save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device."
As long as we stand on the sink of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and is combined with the water.
Then we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which not only ensures the degree of washing, but also saves 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrollment is Enterprise Prospective Employee - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and will be pre-registered as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the procedures for enrollment of students in secondary vocational schools and employment in enterprises be standardized, and that the dual status of apprentices' secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements, and for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but not reached the age of 18, agreements must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests of apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use modern apprenticeship systems to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the internship at the top post is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a teacher can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills needed for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, each with a total of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing it, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students.
The China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children "high-tech" over the "June 1," - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi Zhou Shanshan) The reporter learned from the China Children's Center on May 20 that from May 28 to June 1, around the "June 1" Children's Day, the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as children's maker experience, children's visual arts festival, and parent-child book carnival, so that children can spend the "June 1" in the charm of cutting-edge technology.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 causes more mild symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
This includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19 infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new-crowned patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the rate of severe illness in the previous wave, and the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of COVID-19 patients died recently, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He added: "It's still early, and we need to get the data later."
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading COVID-19 strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounts for more than 90% of cases.
Education Commentary: What is it to save abducted children?
If we are analogous to the famous public service advertisement saying "no sale, no killing," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction," mass prevention and control, and anti-abduction by the whole people, make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency information release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I felt very warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words."
However, before the abduction and trafficking cases are solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
In the context of the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether all abductions and trafficking in children should be punished by death" and other controversial topics can be put aside for a while and discussed with caution, but the rescue of abducted children is not allowed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they are successful.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and recover the child.
After all, "fighting trafficking" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
To fight crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulous law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting children and helping the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three was resting at the train station, and the parents were asleep and woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest between parents, or placing the child under secure protection, is the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the statutory starting point for the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the penalty may be death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is severe. Under the general trend of "lighter punishment," the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, it is not possible to rely only on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for abduction and trafficking is widespread, the abductors are interested in profit, and constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, so as to form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcement, anti-abduction operations will inevitably fall into the mire of inefficiency.
Therefore, the elimination of backward concepts and the popularization of common legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crimes of abduction, trafficking and buying children.

Yang Haodong answered them one by one with popular language and vivid examples. He sent a message to young Party members that they should draw strength from the Party's century-old struggle history, unite closely around the Party Central Committee, unswervingly follow the Party, and write responsibilities and assume responsibilities with youth dedication.

The democracy summit ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the work ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the small fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day,".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Koon-chung addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.
Law also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values."
And that's why we failed.
This is why we have to change., "
During the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" via video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without sealing the city, and we can defeat false information without taking it off the shelves."
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the US Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The girl used as a target to raise money for her sister: "If you think of a skin injury, you will be fine," - Xinhuanet.
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a" target "to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than a person, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
This behavior aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such a drastic move to raise money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street "target" fundraising was warned.
In the picture posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "a", with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink on the board, and her bank account number, WeChat account number, and Alipay account number written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after surfing the Internet.
Some netizens believed that this was an "eyeball begging behavior," and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls at the stall, both about 20 years old, and they were dressed young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl yelled at the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, I could not think of a good way to raise money for the moment, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target and the other was responsible for the attack, but they did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot arrows, but someone looked around and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this kind of eyeball fundraising."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.
Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of the "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer - professional financial news website.
This year, the amount of online payment transactions at the "Double 11" Carnival reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of red envelopes, and the eye-catching live delivery of goods have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom has made people lament the growing consumption power of the people, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents have performed better at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; the "Report on the Indebtedness of Chinese Young People" released by Nielsen and the "China Youth Consumption Report 2019 - 2020" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the overall trend of rational consumption is very different from the label of "excessive profligacy," some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, and therefore, and they have excessive social risks, leading to the financial responsibility of enterprises.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls to take concrete actions to enhance consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
Over the past many years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top universities in China, it has provided reasonable guidance to the consumption needs of young people, helped them to establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption needs rationally, and helped them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, you must plan ahead and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and continuously updated and iterative financial products to provide consumers with more appropriate and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and become a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner.
Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, with a view to addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have condemned for not being able to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that not resolving the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop that the nuclear talks between major powers and Iran have failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time propose measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate in the same frequency - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated over a long period of time in the process of development of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "good morality, good governance," and the patriotic responsibility of "developing a strong country."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying on a global scale. As an important "supply side," the higher education industry is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World First-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" demonstrates the confidence and determination of China to move from a major country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and also puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to be among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still some gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape brand, and enhance the image; third, the advantages of the system, give full play to the advantages of socialist countries, strengthen the goal drive, gather consensus, and optimize the allocation of resources, so as to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catching up with the world advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while making use of its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, tradition of running schools and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to three characteristics in running the school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated and educational environment that integrates science and education, and combines schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation," the common values of "studying diligently, cultivating morality, discerning, and being truthful" and the common values of "Haina River, Enlightenment and Virtue, Enlightenment of the Former People, and the State of Our Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the spirit of "using the talents of the world for our own use," and is expressed as the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous universities in running schools and educating people; "Enlightenment and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, universities should also be cultivated by virtue and cultivated by personality; "The people of the past" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both seeking innovation in knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as reform and development, and innovation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation.
"The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the unformed."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate their building into world-class universities.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit, the spirit of the times and the national spirit interact with each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter: Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States have filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to prestigious American schools has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asian Americans in the three prestigious American schools has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups participating in the complaint, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out" democratic transformation, "abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated a" color revolution, "with disastrous consequences."
'Democracy 'has long been a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including Taiwan's leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own problems with democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both internationally and in the United States, for example, criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were invited to attend the summit. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is morbid, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic conflicts, and the division between rich and poor becoming more and more serious," and that democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my opinion, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign after the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of us implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Educational Thinking: How to Make "Learning Bully" and "Learning Slag" in College Examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the university leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university exam, and proposing to improve the difficulty of the exam and change the test question types so that the exam truly reflects the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of learning, the learning situation varies widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the attack before the exam. If they think of other methods, they may achieve a multiplier effect with half the effort.
As a result, there is a "strange situation" in which "learning scum" can pass the test without investment and even get high marks, and "learning bully" never drops out of class, has good homework and notes, and the exams are not much higher.
From this point of view, it is not unreasonable for students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University to report problems in university exams, and I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for exams by surprise, try to "get" test questions from teachers in various ways, and strive to delineate the scope of the exam, and get "key tutoring" before the exam. It is not even uncommon to have a small copy in the exam and ask the teacher to raise your hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guidance, the measure of a university's passing or not is more about the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions based on it.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. From the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the key."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually composed of question groups, and the examination papers are composed by the senior teachers of the subject, and the examination papers are also taken by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation, and the questions are easily distributed in a normal way according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the type of questions, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability test, and at the same time, innovate the design of the question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans for the exams, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University administration attaches great importance to the students' letter of recommendation, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination of the final exam of the course, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test paper propositions and examination links, refine the evaluation of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the course teaching.
To solve the problem of single type of test questions and repetitive questions from the mechanism is a problem that university exams need to face, and of course a corresponding system needs to be put in place, but kung fu is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, and to understand both sides of the test, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, so that "learning bully" and "scum" will each have their own place.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah were cut off due to special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was depleted, it has not been possible to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the total number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairu Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media that the printing of newspaper papers in Sabah had been a problem.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which led to a delay in the delivery of the paper to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
According to Kailu Aminus, the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform the applicant to go to the local branch office to collect the birth paper.,"
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who leave land border cities in the near future (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and to go to land border cities to have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region or municipality determines the port city scope and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions could study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a differentiated management policy in different regions, and the transformation of one line of prevention and control spillover into two lines of defense, is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve maximum effectiveness in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local concentrated epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice points out that this has exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, inadequate elimination of cold chain items in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific precision in emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the shortcomings of port city prevention and control, to do a good job of prevention and control without relaxation and scientific precision, and to tighten the external defense input line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the protection of people's livelihood at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly screen for emerging hidden dangers in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in the notice include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.
The truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the US military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: Tubing).
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Indiscriminate use of drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and setting up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
A crime against humanity stirs up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the US-style "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorist, more afraid."
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!!
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do" it, and then telling you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do your best at once, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will be recognized as "correct" by anyone who looks at it, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, reinvent yourself, and make a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For a person who sticks to the rules, conforms to the old ways, and refuses to change, you must shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "change" and will not move forward, making it difficult to make a decision; or they will make a determination to "change" with a sudden impulse and take the first step bravely, but often it is not a long time, and they will not persist for a long time before they lose, and it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "Starting Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, making the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is the way that it is possible to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages the theory that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: Because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly a success for all, it ultimately inspires a few, while the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to the previous year, to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu," is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to the large number of human hunts and the increasingly degraded environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, and in 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and major rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial breeding and discharge, cleaning up the main river channels of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passageways."
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, the Qinghai Lake naked carp has been artificially propagated and released nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the source areas of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and has established a comprehensive management system for the prohibition of fishing in "one river, one lake."
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Wanpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling photographed Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhun, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan, four water and colorful tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and black tea have taken turns to promote the integration of tea tourism in the main tea producing areas, which has led to an increase in the income of tea farmers.
Feng Shui turns around, and black tea is strong again.
According to tea experts in the province, after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea plantations has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the license to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua welcomed the "Source of Lake Red."
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
With a touch of red, Xinhua black tea has injected the connotation of tea culture, and the popularity and trading fire have made the Xiang tea industry welcome the new spring.

Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that the Biennale would establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, not only to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.
Yunnan: Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance to the poor and consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare job management, helping to promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs, at present, 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as the labor force, which plays an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly standardize the scope of targets, fund management, job development, and job management for grassroots recruitment for rural public welfare positions.
In terms of job development and establishment, the new regulations clearly state that the establishment shall be based on the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, assigning people to posts, dynamic management, and total volume control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, announcement, employment, pre-job training, and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare jobs, and stipulate that rural public welfare job development departments should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for rural public welfare job placements; and require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare job subsidies.
Mauritius and other countries found the first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua News Agency): Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus strain Omicron.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country for the first time on October 10.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa, and the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected patients turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three are students, and they returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. They were all mild and were not hospitalized.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kunbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has found three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
The country's health authorities sequenced the genomes of 12 new crown positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.
The Geminid meteor shower ushered in on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great shower on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, together with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteors are slow, colorful, and there are many firestorms, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will be at its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly overhead under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was very impressive, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the intensity will be reduced."
The 14th is the 11th of the 11th lunar month, and the moon phase is a convex moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the late hours of the night after the moon, but pay attention to cold and warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place in the suburbs or villages with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of view facing the northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and you can observe it visually."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous meteor shower, you should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
