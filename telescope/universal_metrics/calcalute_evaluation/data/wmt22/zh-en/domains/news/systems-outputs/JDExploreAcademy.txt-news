Students play the leading role in the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University. The research results greatly open people's brains - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, breathe hard to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements that greatly opened the brain were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical treatment, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your family checkup doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You just need to breathe in gently, and this instrument can preliminarily detect the health status of your body from the components of the gas you breathe out."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "smell" enables it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgical lamp: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of the traditional surgical lamp and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The lack of early detection and resection of many diseases is related to the lamp used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early cancer examination, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which can enhance the discrimination of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the national challenge cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most some soap and hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device."
As long as we stand on the washstand, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands!"
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second global major challenges summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Chongqing secondary vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is the enterprise prospective employees - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who accept the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre enrolled as employees by the pilot enterprises.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identities of secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees of apprentices should be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices over the age of 16 but under the age of 18, apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises should sign agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents, rights and interests protection of apprentice training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training school system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can bring 2 ~ 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot, and a total of about 3000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of pilot before implementation and gradual promotion from point to area, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, most of them are mild diseases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of covid-19 is more mild than that caused by the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the associated press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a doctors' organization composed of more than 5000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they currently treat are relatively mild, such as physical pain, cough and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patient needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said, "they can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection.
He said that in contrast, in the last wave of delta epidemic, the patients he treated with covid-19 had "dyspnea and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. "
Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusion of the National Institute of infectious diseases in South Africa: in recent weeks, only 30% of the patients with covid-19 were serious diseases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; The average length of stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; Only 3% of the recent covid-19 patients died, while 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of health, quoted data from the National Institute of infectious diseases and other reports as saying: "at present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease."
He also said, "it is still early, and we need to obtain later data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only have two weeks to enter this epidemic. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although delta is still the main covid-19 strain in the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epidemic center.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Gauteng Province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of cases were of the Omicron variant.
Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy with the famous public service advertisement saying "no sale, no killing," then in a good environment without the demand for "abduction," mass prevention and mass treatment, and anti abduction by the whole people will make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for children's missing information developed by the Anti abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of public security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of children's missing information and timely recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "reunion," I suddenly feel warm.
New technological means are not only named "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also properly applied, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words."
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
There are priorities. Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help," controversial topics such as "whether abduction and trafficking of children should be subject to the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed carefully; But the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to leaving the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction search is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from his parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "reunion" platform, which is directly conducive to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "cracking down on abductions" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, as well as the meticulous law enforcement, we all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at the railway station. Their parents are asleep and wake up to find that their children are missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the criminal law of our country, the legal starting point of the crime of abducting and selling children is 5 years; If the circumstances are especially serious, he may be sentenced to death and concurrently be sentenced to confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. Under the general trend of "light punishment," the crime of abducting and selling children obviously belongs to the crime of heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of raising children and have weak legal awareness.
The legal education of these people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, and the abductors are greedy for profits, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a "law fight" situation with law enforcers, the anti abduction action is bound to fall into the mud of low efficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward ideas and popularizing legal common sense will also help eradicate the crime of abducting and selling children.

At the end of the democracy summit, Biden said that the fire of freedom will never go out
The online "summit for democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the autocratic regime can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and a councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, "we know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The autocratic regime can never extinguish the micro fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "as leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better withstand the buffer and impact of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "democracy summit" are to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confront authoritarianism, as well as counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day."
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges in the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "it is time to reaffirm common values and positions as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, addressed the summit through a pre recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "for a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said, "maybe some of you are afraid of annoying General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you don't realize the threat of (the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, administrative Councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, attended the roundtable discussion on "combating digital dictatorship and affirming the value of democracy," and released the "national statement" by video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "at a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can defeat false information without getting off the shelves. "
Just as the agenda of the second day of the "democracy summit" was going on, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have seriously violated human rights, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "it's OK to think of skin injuries" - Xinhuanet
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, on which the words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" are written.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an aggressive move only after she raised money for her sister, but this behavior is not worth advocating. After warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "arrow target" fund-raising defendant admonished
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stood in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "a." The words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" were written in black ink on the board. Her bank account, WeChat account, Alipay account, etc. were written on another board in front of her.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this was "eye-catching begging behavior," and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of Tianshui police station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl helped shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of operation expenses. Please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity director of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, as the treatment still needs more than 300000 expenses, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money for the moment, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for fighting, but they did not participate in it. During the whole process, no archery was found, but someone gathered and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified by the public security department that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "this eye-catching fund-raising method is not advocated."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.
Home credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "double 12" - economic observation network - professional financial news website
This year's "double 11" Carnival, the national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
A wide variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts once again benefit consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is becoming stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "double 12," home credit consumer finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "home credit") issued a rational consumption initiative to remind users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the consumer financial literacy survey and analysis report released by the people's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but they show great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; According to the "debt situation report of young people in China" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 consumption report of young people in China" released by CCTV finance and economics, the young generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" pasted by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, home credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the regulatory call to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions.
Over the past years, home credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and imperceptibly guided the consumption needs of young people by launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic colleges and universities, helping them establish a rational consumption concept and reasonably plan their consumption needs, so as to help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the double 12, home credit reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumption lending, so as not to affect personal credit investigation and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, home credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and appropriate lending, and become a lifelong reliable consumer finance partner for consumers.
Vietnam People's Daily Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to meet common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Arab countries in the Gulf resolve their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of the requirement that they must unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, in order to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725km long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Arabia's public investment fund (PIF) will invest US $5 billion in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth US $30 billion.
The visit of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers on rescuing the Iranian nuclear agreement called the joint comprehensive action plan (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab countries for believing that it could not solve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the background that the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time put forward various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school running concepts and value pursuits accumulated for a long time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in a modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which rose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply affected by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "serving the world with virtue, cultivating Qi and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "building a strong country with learning."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan for comprehensively promoting the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become one of the most popular universities in the world in a relatively short time, speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "overtaking on corners"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the late development advantage, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school running quality; Second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past five thousand years, carry forward and develop excellent traditional culture, so as to condense strength, shape brand and improve image; Third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal driving, pool consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should be aware that it is impossible to build a world-class university with thousands of schools. Each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, school running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: first, highlight the training characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and combining schools and enterprises, and form a full chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the school running system and social service characteristics, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the pan Zhejiang University industry university research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation," the common values of "diligent study, moral cultivation, discernment and honesty" and the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University are "accepting rivers, enlightening truth and virtue, opening things to the former people, and building our country."
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "hainajiang River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "using the world's talents for my own use," and embodies the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous schools to educate people; "Enlightening truth and strengthening virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the encouragement of personality while pursuing truth; "People before opening things" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also the reform and development, innovation and innovation; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and it says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of schooling.
"The wise listen to the silent, and the wise see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian American groups complain about enrollment discrimination in three Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Jianmei) - more than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of education and the Department of justice on the 23rd to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the enrollment process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission conditions of famous American schools has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "discriminate against Asian students on a long-term basis and systematically" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that the research of Saunders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest proportion of Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua news agency that they expected the U.S. Department of education and the Department of justice to investigate after submitting the complaint, and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment after finding the facts.
They also hope that the complained colleges and universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change the enrollment policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three colleges and universities complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about Harvard University's enrollment discrimination, but the U.S. Department of education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani Americans also participated in the appeal.
After the "democracy summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the "leading the people's democratic summit" held by the United States was "to draw an ideological line, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, oppose democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and transfer domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', causing disastrous consequences.
'democracy 'has long become a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held by video, and leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices in the world and in the United States. For example, it is criticized that some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, were invited to the meeting. Some people doubt that the real intention of the Biden government is not to organize the summit for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is morbid, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, ethnic contradictions, and polarization between the rich and the poor are getting worse." American democracy is a "rich game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "as leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better withstand the buffer and impact of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges."
The United States promised to launch a one-year action after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Educational thinking: how to make "learning tyrants" and "learning dregs" take their place in college examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college examinations have been a "hot topic."
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, and their ability levels are different. In addition, their learning levels are different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, with high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning dregs" who can pass the exam and even get high scores without investment at ordinary times; "Xueba" usually never misses classes, and his homework and notes are all good, and his exams are not much higher than the "strange status quo."
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems existing in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to rush to prepare for the exam and find various ways to "get" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. Even it is not strange to bring a cheat sheet in the exam and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guidance of teaching quality evaluation, measuring whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to comprehensively master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content of the university examination.
However, undergraduate knowledge is basically subject basic theory and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, there is little room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, I studied the basic knowledge of college mathematics, but now I'm still learning it, which is still the key."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will form the examination paper as a whole. The examination marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty and ease of the questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and ease and the question type, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and carry out innovative design of the question type at the same time.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plans for examinations. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' suggestions and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and self-examination of the course completion examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
To solve the problems of single type of examination questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is the issue that the university examination needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but kung fu is important in daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation. If they have a thorough understanding of both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more realistic, so that "learning tyrants" and "learning dregs" can get their own way.
3200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, November 11) Sabah National Registration Bureau said that since the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was used up, it has been unable to issue birth paper to newborn babies since early October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200 so far.
However, the director of the Bureau, kerouaminus, promised that the information of all infants who had applied for birth registration paper had been recorded in the system and would be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrived next week.
At the press conference, he explained an online media report that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah newspaper had occurred for 10 months.
He said that the relevant problems appeared two months ago, and Sarawak is also facing the same problems.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in the delay of delivery to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from that in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah and immediately print the final stage. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to get birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24801 birth papers so far this year.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone," the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document calling for strengthening the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) - the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in port cities, requiring personnel who recently leave land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel who go to land border port cities should be tested for nucleic acid at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and cities determine the scope of port cities and make an announcement to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of disease prevention and control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the border residents of both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policies, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning, non implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formalistic regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold chain items in all links, non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the weaknesses in the prevention and control of port cities, do a good job in the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and organize and strengthen the input defense line of external defense.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in time.
The truth of the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military - Xinhuanet
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro documentary called "killing machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity after 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents.
Abuse drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to impose all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have aroused hatred among more Afghans.
As the video said, the American "war on terror" is "more anti-terrorism."
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful learning books.
Nowadays, many success books advocate the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
It means that we have crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" at once.
For this reason, these books have a common feature - either work hard to the best, or do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will make anyone admit that it is "extremely correct," but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you should make up your mind to be a new person and make a 180 degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conformist, conformist and refuse to change, you must shout "you want to change" in his ear. Undoubtedly, it is self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid and hesitant in front of the word "change," and it is difficult to make up their minds; Or with a temporary impulse, they made a painful determination to "change" and took the first step bravely, but often the good times did not last long, and they failed in a short time, so it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "from tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this classic of "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on the road of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "turning small victories into big victories," that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your door, because it's always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to adhere to it, and as long as they adhere to everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
In a word, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, in fact, it can inspire a few in the end; Only the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit more people as much as possible.
Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves increased by 7100 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) - the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of agriculture and rural affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Mackerel," is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, affected by a large number of human hunting and the increasingly degraded water environment for naked carp breeding, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 was only 2592 tons.
Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "red list of Chinese species" in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibited any units, collectives and individuals from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and their products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main river channels into Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continue to strengthen protection, the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of agriculture and rural affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially propagated and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of "one river, one river, and one lake."

The Ministry of health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron virus infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
These three people are all students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized due to mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus, the Serbian government has continuously strengthened prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Serbian Ministry of health also announced on the 10th that Pfizer covid-19 vaccine will be vaccinated for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.

The Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great event on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Runjian) - astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Beijing astronomer An Jiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent objects of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid faerton 3200, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "gestated" by comets.
Xiulipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on astronomical science popularization, said that like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A remarkable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, colorful, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at about 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'colorful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the brilliance will be slightly discounted.
The 14th is November 11 of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a convex moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but they should pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light damage and an open field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to keep staring at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
If friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbusters', they had better choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, backup batteries and shutter wires are also essential. "
Xiulipeng reminded.
