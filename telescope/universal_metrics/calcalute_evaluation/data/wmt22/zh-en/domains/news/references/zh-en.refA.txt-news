Students played the leading role at the Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University with creative research achievements - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone.
“All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out.”
Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone.
Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately.
Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms.
This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp.
“Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors.”
According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread.
This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits.
This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition.
Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way
Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air”.
As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out.
“Just like an inflator.
The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water.
As such, we can wash our hands clean!”
Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.

Doctors from South Africa: Although more transmissible, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that patients infected by Omicron are milder cases compared with those infected by Delta, although Omicron is more transmissible.
According to report from the Associated Press, as Omicron is being transmitted in South Africa, a report by a physician organization composed by more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa says that most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, such as body ache and cough, which are similar to symptoms of flu.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief supervisor of the organization, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said, “Their diseases can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after quarantine of 10 to 14 days.”
He said that those included aged patients and patients with health problems, who were easier to become severe cases due to infection of the COVID-19.
He said that, in comparison, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them needed to be hospitalized within only a few days”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of Omicron the new variant in South Africa.
Although it will take some more weeks to collect sufficient evidence, observation and early proof from doctors have provided some clues.
According to the summary made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the last few weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which accounts for a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.
By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease.”
He also said: “However, it’s still at early stage, and we need to obtain data of later stage.
In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic.”
At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 virus strain of the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries with South Africa at the center of the epidemic.
According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.
Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand of “buying abducted children”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again.
Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children.
I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion”.
This new technical means not only has an “artistic” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective.
The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary.
In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.
However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority.
There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as “if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.
Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases.
In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children.
After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system.
To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement.
In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society.
Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up.
You cannot expect a 2-year-old child to protect himself/herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness.
The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too.
Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain.
According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property.
Under the trend of “light sentencing”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence.
However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year.
It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness.
Legal education should be provided to these people.
It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling.
If the “market” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency.
Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong publicized the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC and the provincial congress of Party representatives.
Draw energy from the history of the 100 years of struggle of the Party

In the interaction and exchange part, representatives of grass-rooted cadres, representatives of enterprises and representatives of young people asked questions about relationship among the three historical resolutions, correct understanding on decisive significance of the “two-establishment”, the way for cultural enterprises to master the orientation and the way for young people to abstract energy from the Party’s 100-year history; Yang Haodong answered the questions in plain language and with vivid cases, and he hoped the young Party members would abstract energy for progress from the history of the Party of 100 years, be unified around the Party Central Committee and follow the decisions made by the Party unswervingly and write responsibility and undertaking with youth and contributions.

The Summit for Democracy ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom would never extinguish
The online “Summit for Democracy” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private sector from 110 countries came to a close on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in the closing speech that a dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.
He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was scheduled to be held next year.
Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere.
A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.”
Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy.
He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits.”
The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.
That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day”.
Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, “It’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy.
Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions.”
Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans.
He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.
This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders.
We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China.
He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
And this is the reason why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must make changes.”
When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID-19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust.
He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it.”
On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.

Home Credit advocated rational consumption to consumers before the “Double Twelve” sale - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
During the “Double Eleven” festival this year, the amount of national online payment business transaction reached 1.77 trillion yuan, creating a new high when compared with that of previous years.
Various kinds of coupons and the eye-catching live-streaming sales once again make consumers feel they’ve gained benefits; this spending spree makes people feel amazed at the increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people need to calm down and think about the influences of consumerism on society and modern mainstream consumer groups.
Before the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit B.V. (hereinafter referred to as “Home Credit”) advocated rational consumption, reminding its users, especially young users, to develop good consumption awareness and habits, and reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the Report of Survey Analysis on Financial Literacy of Consumers published by People’s Bank of China this year, the financial literacy index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 compared with that of 2019.
Generally speaking, citizens in our country have good performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences in various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement of popularization of basic financial knowledge shall be made.
Level of financial literacy of senior citizens and young people is relatively low, and they will still be the key objects of financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People from 2019 to 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading; 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt buildup; although there is a relatively rational consumption trend among the younger generation, which is drastically different from the label of “excessive squander” put on them by society, some young people indeed are involved in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even resulting in increasing social problems; financial enterprises shall shoulder their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive way.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been engaged in helping citizens construct their own happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of the supervision units so as to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers, with practical actions.
In the past years, Home Credit has been holding comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aiming at young people, including university students; in addition, it has unconsciously offered reasonable guidance on the consumption demands of young groups by means such as cooperating with top universities in the country to host innovative practice competitions, so as to help students establish rational consumption concept and plan for consumption demands reasonably, and to assist them in accumulating life fortunes.
Upon the arriving of the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish rational consumption awareness and correct concept of money, resist blind and excessive consumption, and avoid forming misunderstanding of loan for consumption, in case it will impact personal credit investigation and economic life in the future.
Be sure to plan in advance when making consumption, live beneath your means, and make repayment as schedule.
If it’s overdue, related overdue behavior will be recorded in personal credit report, which may lead to adverse influences on economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, be sure to choose authorized institutions and channels and check if related institutions have the qualification for operation.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to provide consumers with diversified services fitting their demands with mature and reliable consumption finance systems and constantly upgraded financial products, so as to improve the public’s financial knowledge level and help consumers develop the concepts of rational consumption and taking out loans in moderation, and be a consumption finance partner which consumers can trust for a lifetime.
Vietnamese People’s Daily Website - Gulf Cooperation Council tackle common challenges
The locations where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince stayed include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of the year 2017 and led to the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a full embargo; they blamed Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, exerting a negative influence on economy of the countries and regions in that region.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, 2021, when the gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
Arab countries in the gulf aimed to resolve divergence; and restoring relations with Qatar originates from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period when the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land road passage between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A passage of 725km connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding of cooperation worth 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries happened as the negotiation was ongoing between Iran and major countries about saving a nuclear deal named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as it’s believed it cannot solve the missile issue with Iran.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term “competitor” and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as a “threat” to regional security.
According to the gulf countries, it is defective not to solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not to take actions to curb the activities of Iran in this region.
Under the backdrop where the nuclear negotiation between major countries and Iran was not able to meet the demand of the gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading of the tense situations in this region.

Let university spirit resonate with spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
University spirit refers to a series of educational philosophy and pursuit of values an university accumulates in its long-term development; it is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, university spirit is indispensable in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology and society, as well as in the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the first real university in the world, universities shoulder unique missions which are different from other social organizations; universities in our country emerged in times of national crisis; its spirit is heavily influenced by traditional culture and the change of times; it advocates the values of “benefiting the world with virtue, and governing the country with integrity” and the patriotic responsibility of “building a strong country by studying”.
At present, with the increasingly prominent trend of informatization and globalization of higher education, competition of education, science and technology, and talent across the world are continuously fiercer; higher education is an important “supply end”, and the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the issuing of the General Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Disciplines showcases the confidence and determination of our country in the transformation from a giant of higher education to a strong country of higher education; at the same time, it also puts forward higher and newer demands on development of universities.
How to ascend to the top in the world within a short time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines while there is still a gap, and “overtake on a bend”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the advantage of backwardness; through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, significantly improve the academic level and school running quality; the second one is the cultural advantage; inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and carrying forward excellent traditional culture, unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is system advantage; give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen objective driving, collect consensus and joining forces, optimize resource configuration, and provide sustainable and solid support for the university to speed up catching up with and surpassing the world advanced level.
It shall be especially noted that in order to construct world-class universities, the universities shall manifest their uniqueness and their own characteristics at the same time of giving full play to its advantages.
Running an university has to possess the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective positioning, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are emphasized in our operation: the first one is to highlight the special training of innovation and entrepreneurship talents: construct integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, and the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of cross-discipline convergence: promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, build the environment of the cross-discipline system, and actively cultivate results of cross-discipline and emerging discipline research and landmark cross-discipline achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate forming the industry-university research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the university motto of “seeking truth and making innovation”, the common values of “study diligently, cultivate morality, foster discernment, advocate honesty” and the principles of “harboring generosity like the ocean, seeking the truth while upholding morality, being brave enough to keep exploring, and building our country” constitute the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
The university insists on the correct direction of running an university, continuously accumulates the altitude of culture and the important support by condensing the power of spirit; it has profound connotations and far-reaching significance.
In which, “harboring generosity like the ocean” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of “inviting all talents”, which is manifested as absorbing the premium concepts of university operation and talent training of world famous universities; “seeking the truth while upholding morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of the pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall accept the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality while pursuing for truth; “being brave enough to keep exploring” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, as well as reform, development and innovation; “building our country”stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, meaning that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
These spiritual ethos and the pursuit of values are the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of university running.
“Wise people can hear when there is only silence and see before things are formed.”
Universities and colleges in China shall further master the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of top universities in the world.
At the same time, hold fast to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, spirit of the times and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide infinite power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and the common ideal of all human beings.

Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.
According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.
According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process.
As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants.
Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts.
They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.
The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet.
Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the “Democracy Summit” on Friday, the spokesperson of Foreign Ministry of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11), stating that the United States hosting the “Leaders’ Democracy Summit” to “make democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy in the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation and to shift domestic contradictions”.
According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has been imposing its own political systems and values on others, carried out ‘democratic transformation’, used unilateral sanction indiscriminately and has instigated ‘Color Revolution’, leading to disastrous consequences.
“Democracy has long become the weapon of mass destruction the United States used to interfere with other countries.
The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.
The meetings during the 2-days summit were held via video call, and leaders from 111 countries were invited to attend the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.
China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There were doubts internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for inviting leaders who had the tendency to be authoritarians, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspected that the real intention of the Biden government was geopolitics, not democracy.
German Chancellor Scholz who just took office also attended the video Democracy Summit.
According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “the American democracy today is morbid, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital.
The U.S. President, Biden, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability and governance, to fight against the power of impact of buffer of autocracy and those who bluntly pursue power before public benefits.”
He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, “we must keep update it in every generations which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are “facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy should be guarded by fighters”.
The United States promised that after this Democracy Summit, it will carry out a series of year-long actions including a 424.4 million USD initiative to strengthen democracy around the globe and provide support to independent new media.
The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and open promises before the democratic summit held at the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
Biden said, “let’s all fulfill our promises and report our progresses next year”.
Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.
Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.
Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.
It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.
Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.
In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.
Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.
Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.
Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.
As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content.”
However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.
There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.
It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.
Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.

Negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and setting up a "buffer zone", the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice about strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, asking people who recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold the negative result of nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should take the nucleic acid test at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the aforementioned request is from the date when the province, autonomous region and city determine the scope of port cities and announce it until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases.
The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control.
YouTube video uncovers the truth of US army’s bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
(source of video: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube.
The documentary tells of various kinds of antihuman crimes committed by the US, including launching the war against Afghanistan in the name of “anti-terrorism”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, exhausting its resources to build up its military power, being obsessive about bloodthirsty killing, and massacring the innocent at will for 20 years.
The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature.
The US army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
The US army set up “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”.
Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from even more Afghan civilians.
Just as what the video says, American anti-terrorism war “is creating more terrorism”.
The war did not bring peacefulness, democracy, prosperity or hope to Afghan people; instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!
Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet
We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.
Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do.
It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”.
As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.
The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.
Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.
The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.
From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”.
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”.
Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.
The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.
Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.
Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,
It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”.
In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.
The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water, fish, bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.
In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.
Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake”.

“It is not advised to observe meteor showers in the city; you may choose a place facing northeast and has high altitude, a wide view and little light pollution, and then you may observe with your eyes after the moon goes down.
It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have heavy flows on all directions, and you do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
People who like photography can select wide angle lens and large aperture, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting if you want to take marvelous shots of the meteor shower.
Based on consideration of stability and sustainability, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are also necessary.”
