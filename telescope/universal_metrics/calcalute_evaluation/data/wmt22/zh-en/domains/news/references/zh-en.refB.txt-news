Students played a leading role in the academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, with research achievements of miraculous things - Xinhuanet
Washing with air, judging disease with halitus and seeking for source of haze, a series of academic achievements of miraculous things at the opening ceremony of 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University were honored yesterday evening.
The main researchers of the achievements are students, with research fields covering environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanistic education; students created high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have been awarded at home and abroad.
Biosensor: your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, with the size of only a half of that of a smart phone.
“You need only to take a breath, and this set of device can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the air you breathe. ”
According to introduction from Zhang Diming, this set of sensor is connected with a smart phone, and the report of physical conditions will be shown on the smart phone after you take a breath.
Most smart wristband detecting physical conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
However, this set of biosensor can detect chemical elements by utilizing a new material, i.e., graphene, to reflect the physical conditions in a deeper and more accurate way with sharp “smell”.
Smart operating lamp: powerful eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are popular in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded with a golden prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland in this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two postgraduates from School of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in defects of traditional operating lamps, inventing the smart LED operating shadowless lamp.
“Improper early detection and excision of many diseases are related to operating lamps used by doctors. ”
According to Shen Junfei, by taking early inspection of cancers as an example, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues, the tumor cells will still diffuse.
This kind of smart operating lamp has four lamp panels, which strengthen the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of facula, brightness degree, spectrum, color uniformness and shadowless rate at any time according to needs in operation and personal habits.
This kind of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, with favorable feedback.
The invention was awarded with the first prize in National Challenge Cup in last October.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Most people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap or sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his friends invented a set of “hand washing device with air”.
When a person stands on the wash basin of the device, his weight can compress the air and make it spray out.
“It’s just like an inflator.
The compressed air forms flow at the faucet, which is combined with water.
In this way, we can wash hands clean! ”
According to the chromogenic reaction and the germ residue experiment result: the effect of hand washing in this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
With the driving force of body weight, this device can ensure cleanness degree and save 90% of water, with no energy consumption during the whole process, which is energy saving and environmentally protective.
In the last year, at the 2nd global great challenge summit, this invention was awarded with the only gold award among all the global top famous universities.

Doctors of South Africa: Although with strong transmission, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
According to lots of doctors and medical experts in South Africa, most of the patients infected by Omicron are milder cases, although it has faster transmission speed.
According to report from the Associated Press, with the transmission of Omicron in South Africa, as reported by a physician organization composed by more than 5000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, those similar with flu such as body ache and cough.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief inspector of the organizations, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: “Their disease can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after isolation of 10 to 14 days. ”
He said that aged patients or those with health problems were included, who were easier to be caught in severe cases due to infection of the corona virus.
He said, with a comparison, the patients of COVID-19 of the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them should be hospitalized within only a few days”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of the Omicron new variant in South Africa.
Although some more weeks are needed to collect sufficient evidences; observation and early proof of doctors have provided some clues.
According to the summarization made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within latest weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which were a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which was as high as 20% in the cases of early epidemic in South Africa.
By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of Africa Institute of Health said: “At present, almost all the traces indicate that this is a relatively mild disease. ”
He also said: “However, it’s the early stage, and we need acquire data of later stage.
In general conditions, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s just two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic. ”
At the same time, scientists all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as the effect of the current vaccine and the therapeutic method at present.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 viral strain all over the whole world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, in which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng Province in the first week of December were increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases occupied more than 90%.
Review on education: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand on “abduction”, if people can prevent and fight against abduction, to make it no benefit to acquire, such crime will not happy again.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of missing children information developed by the Crackdown on the Abduction of Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has been put into operation.
This is an Internet information platform, which is established for releasing information of missing children, so that the abducted children can be found back in time.
With the name of “reunion”, the App is so warm.
With new technological means, the App has not only “artistic” and full of feelings, but also appropriate, practical and effective information means.
In order to fight against abduction, the first objective is to find out the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
The judgment and punishment to the criminal suspect is the secondary thing.
With the significance of criminal punishment, there are lots of “major terms” from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before solving a case, the most important thing is the safety of the victim.
There are orders of priority; suspend the discussion on topics with large disputes such as “if death penalty shall be sentenced to suspect of abducting children” before “seeking and rescuing” children; rescuing them is the most urgent thing.
According to the experience in solving such cases, traders in human beings usually run away from the crime location as soon as possible.
Therefore, every more minute indicates more difficulty in seeking and rescuing of children and solving of the case.
In this condition, it is a practical action to establish a platform such as “reunion”, so as to provide an effective method to solve the case and find the children.
After all, “crackdown on the abduction” is a big task in need of the operation of the whole legal system.
The care of “protecting children” shall be implemented in improvement on legislation, judicial safeguard and careful enforcement for fighting against crime, protecting rights and benefits of children and parents.
In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from family to the society.
By taking a common case as an example, parents and the child had a rest in the train station, and the parents found their child lost after they woke up.
It is unpractical to expect that a child of 2 years old can protect himself/herself sufficiently; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least equivalent protection awareness.
The father and the mother can take turns in sleeping, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the elementary approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
Viewing from the other side of crackdown on abduction, the party that purchases the abducted children shall be noticed and punished, too.
Any single illegal behavior is generally one link of a long chain.
According to the Penal Code, in our country, the legal minimum standard for the crime of child abduction is 5 years; suspects with especially serious plots can be sentenced to death penalty, with properties confiscated.
With high minimum standard for the crime and heavy maximum standard, under the trend of the “lightening of punishment”, the crime of child abduction is a crime with relatively heavy sentence.
However, there have been lots of cases of child abduction so far.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas and weak legal consciousness in bringing up children.
It is necessary to provide them with legal education.
Strict enforcement of laws is insufficient for effective control of the crime of child abduction.
If the “market” of buying children widely exists, and abductors keep innovating abduction approaches, forming the pattern of “fighting against” law-executors, the crackdown on the abduction will inevitably be of low efficiency.
Therefore, removing outdated ideas and popularizing common legal knowledge contribute to taking a radical cure to child abduction and child buying.

Home Credit advocated to rational consumption to consumers before the “Double Twelve” - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
During the “Double Eleven” festival of this year, national website payment business transaction amount achieved 1.77 trillion yuan, creating a new high when compared with previous years.
The red packets for special offer when spending enough of various types and the attractive live-streaming sales make consumers gain benefits; on the one hand, this spending spree makes people feel increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people have to cool down to consider the influences of the consumerism on social and modern mainstream consumer groups.

According to the Survey Analysis Report about Financial Quality of Consumers published by People’s Bank of China in this, the financial quality index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 when compared with that of 2019.
Generally speaking, our citizens have favorable performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences on various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement in basic financial knowledge shall be conducted.
Senior citizens and young people have relatively low financial quality level, and they are still the key objects by financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People of 2019 – 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has been an important approach for consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation; although the young generation shows relatively rational consumption trend, which is different from the label of “excessive squander”, some young people indeed involve in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, or even increasingly grown social problems; financial enterprises shall take social responsibilities and guide in a positive way.

Plan ahead is very important for consumption, to achieve acting according to capability and making payment as schedule.
In overdue conditions, related behavior will be recorded in personal credit report, which may lead to adverse influences on economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is needed to select regular institutions and channels, and check if related institutions have the qualification for operation.

Vietnamese People’s Daily – Gulf Cooperation Council coped with common challenges.
The places where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince, stayed included Oman, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis caused by embargo implemented by Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances to Qatar in the middle of the year 2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implement comprehensive embargo; they blamed Qatar on supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions led to serious influences on internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, resulting in negative influences on economy of countries in related regions.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, 2021, and various gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt took the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The divergence of the Arab countries in the gulf was resolved, to recover the relations with Qatar, for the purpose of unity for benefits of various countries and regional stabilization, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land route channel between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A channel of 725km connecting between the two countries will provide convenience for travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD to Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation of 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries coincided with the negotiation on an Iran nuclear deal named as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and major countries all over the whole world, an agreement that was regarded as cannot solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran by Arab countries in the gulf.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term "competitor" and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as the "threat" to regional security.
According to various gulf countries, it is defective to not solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not restrain the activity of Iran in this region with certain actions.
As the nuclear negotiation between various major countries and Iran cannot meet the demand of various gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading od the tense situations in this region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that make contributions to recovering the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges, to make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.

Colleges and universities have undertaken unique mission different from other social organizations since the establishment of the first university of the modern significance; for universities and colleges in our country, they emerged during the time of stress of our country, with the spirit deeply influenced by traditional culture and time changes; the value idea of “benefitting the mankind and assisting in nation governance” and the patriotism of “developing the country through education” was advocated.
At present, with increasingly prominent trend of information and internationality in higher education, there are increasingly fierce education competition, science and technology competition and talent competition all over the whole world; as the important “supply end”, the structural reform of higher education is facing with unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the proposal of the General Scheme for Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Subjects shows the confidence and determination of our country in developing to a giant of higher education from a big country of higher education, which proposes higher and newer requirements on development of universities.
How to rank among the best in the world with a short time, to construct global top universities and global top subjects in the condition of some differences, to realize “corner overtaking”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the late-mover advantage: realizing significant improvement on academic level and school operation quality by introducing overseas excellent academic talents and learning advanced experience from global top universities; the second one is the cultural advantage: inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and developing excellent traditional culture, to unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is the system advantage: give play to the superiority of the system in the socialist country, strengthening objective driving, collecting consensus and resultant force, optimizing resource configuration, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to catch up with and surpass the world advanced standard.
It shall be realized that in order to construct global top universities, universities shall manifest individualities and characteristics at the same time of bringing superiority into full play.
The school operation characteristics shall reflect the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective location, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
With respect to Zhejiang University, features on three aspects are emphasized in school operation: the first one is to highlight the features of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training: constructing integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, to form the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of crossed subjects: promoting optimized adjustment of subject system, building the environment of the crossed-subject system, and actively training the crossed emerging subjects and the landmark crossed achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: developing deep international exchange and cooperation and accelerating forming the industry-university-research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
During this process, the most important thing is insisting on the university spirit, to achieve the same frequency and resonance between university spirit and time spirit.
As for Zhejiang University, the school motto of “truth and innovation”, the common value system of “diligence, morality, discrimination and honesty” as well as “inclusiveness, reality, morality, practice and country governance” constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is the school operation direction and the important guarantee for cultural accumulation and mental strength, with abundant connotation and profound significance.
In which, “inclusiveness” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mind of “inviting all talents”, expressed as adopting the good idea of school operation and talent training in world famous schools; “reality and morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall pay attention to morality at the same time of pursuing for truth; “practice” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, expressed as reform, development and innovation; “country governance” lays emphasis on the spirit of love the country and contribution, saying that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
The series of spiritual idea and value pursuit is the spirit of Zhejiang University with the history of 120 years.
“Clever people can hear speechless voices and wisdom people can see invisible things”.
It is necessary for universities and colleges in China to further master the time direction and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, to accelerate to become world top universities.
At the same time, stick to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, time spirit and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and common ideal of human.

According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has imposed its own political systems and value systems on others, to carry out democratic transformation, and has sanctioned others in a unilateral way, and has instigated Color Revolution, leading to disastrous consequences.
Democracy has been the weapons of mass destruction of the U.S. in intervening other countries.
The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.

Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet
Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet
Indeed, college examination has always been a “hot topic” for a very long time.
Students in campuses are from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels, as well as different learning conditions due to varied learning degree.
It is unavoidable that there are different feelings on the examination on groups with such diversified characteristics.
Of course, single question types, high repetitive rate and excessively simple questions will lead to another totally different feeling.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam with focused review before exam; if they have other methods, they may half the work with double results.
In this way, “study slackers” can pass exams or even with high scores although they do not study hard; however, “super scholars” have scores not obviously higher than “study slackers” although they attend each class and do well in assignments and notes.
In this way, the reflection of the problems in college exams by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University is reasonable; it is believed such status does not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point, the 3 students who wrote the letter shall be praised.
In fact, all people who have been to colleges know that there are frequent phenomena of focused review, “extracting” exam questions from teachers, knowing the scope of the questions and acquiring the “key coaching” before exam; even more, there are phenomena of bringing notes to exam rooms or begging teachers to give high marks after exams.
According to the author, as a tool for teaching quality evaluation, in order to measure if the college exam is qualified or not, it is on comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the scientific questions on this basis.
Specialties are divided in details after entering into the undergraduate college stage, and many specialized courses are taught based on basic knowledge.
Without a doubt, the comprehensive mastering of the basic knowledge points of a specialty is the content to be inspected by college exams.
However, the knowledge of the undergraduate courses is basically basic specialty theory and basic commonsense, with not much space for changes from the point of view of knowledge points, which is basically fixed.
Just as what teachers said, “the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still key point at present. ”
However, no change in knowledge points does not represent for single exam question types and repetition of questions.
In many universities, there is the group of questions for exams, and senior teachers of related specialties arrange the papers, and the paper inspection work is participated by all the teachers of related subjects; in this way, it solves the problem of repetitive questions to certain extent.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficult degree according to general learning conditions of students, analyze learning degree of students, to lay emphasis on both basic knowledge inspection and ability inspection; at the same time, it is necessary to conduct creative design on question types.
College exam is the wand of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exam will give rise to influences on effect of college education for a long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter from the students, and has deployed the scheme for rectification in the whole university.
Various teaching units are required to organize teachers to develop discussion and self-inspection on class ending exam, and formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, and strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and audit, and detail grade evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive check on various teaching links.
It is a inevitable topic for college exam to solve problems such as single question types and repetitive questions from the perspective of mechanism; it is necessary to release corresponding systems; in addition, teachers are required to master teaching conditions in a comprehensive way by mastering both the teaching contents and the learning conditions of students; it is necessary to connect between teaching and learning, to form benign interaction and make exam in accordance with practical conditions, so as to make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places.

A video of YouTube revealed the truth of bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
(Source of the video: YouTube)
On December 11, a mini-documentary named Killing Machine of YouTube attracted broad attention.
The documentary tells all kinds of antihuman crimes by the U.S., including waging war in Afghanistan with the name of “anti-terrorist”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, using all armed might to indulge in aggressive wars, being fond of killing and indiscriminating slaughter of countless innocent victims for 20 years.
The U.S. army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing group, distorting human natures.
The U.S. army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
In addition, the U.S. army established “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”.
Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from more Afghanistan civilians.
Just as what the video tells, the U.S. “anti-terrorist” war “is increasingly terroristic”.
Wars did not bring in peacefulness, democracy, prosperousness or wish; instead, they brought in a country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
Let us click the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorist”, and reveal the false mask of American democracy!
Don’t intimidate people at the starting line – Xinhuanet
We can feel the popularity of books of success science when we go to bookstores.
Most of the books of success science today advocate “the best principle”; i.e., it is firstly assumed or implied that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what is” the thing you need to do.
As much as to say, the most important and the most fundamental link of “how to do it” is passed.
For this reason, these books have the same characteristic: either doing the best or doing nothing; either 100 or 0; either climbing on the Mount Tai or keeping standing still.
All people will regard the “best principle” “really correct”; however, 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that “you need to make the resolution to totally change yourself”, which is just the critical weakness of many people.
If you shout “you need to change” loudly to people who stick to conventions and refuse changes, it is deceiving yourself as well as others and casting pearls before swine.
Most people display their ignorance before the word “change”, and difficult to make the resolution; or they may make the resolution of “change” because of momentary impulse, and take the first step; however, good times don’t last long, and it is very difficult for them to insist on it.
From Tomorrow on, the cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli, expresses the “common humanity” in the most vivid way.
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the very high starting difficulty, which exceeds the limit of ability of ordinary people, making most people “bemoaning inadequacy in the face of a great task”.
Maybe the “second best principle” is the way that makes more ordinary people step to success.
The core of the “second best principle” is on “lowering down the threshold”; it advocates to the theory of “accumulating small progresses to make large ones”; i.e., people who cannot achieve 100 can achieve at least 1, because 1 is always larger than 0; if people cannot climb on Mount Tai, they can also climb on the small sand dune around home, because it is better than marching on the spot.
In general, it’s better than doing nothing as long as you do something.
The possibility of insisting for ordinary people is greatly increased due to great drop in the starting difficulty, and the success possibility is increased as long as people can insist on it.
The journey to success by observing the “second best principle” is a little longer.
In general, although the “best principle” advocates to make all people success, it can encourage only a small part of people; however, the “second best principle” can encourage more people, to try to make more people gain benefit.

At the same time, the protection intensity has been increased by measures such as artificial proliferation and discharge, cleaning up the river ways of main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable “channels for fish”, leading to increase of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake by years.
According to introduction by Yang Lin, deputy director general of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, totally 180 million naked carp has been conducted with artificial proliferation and discharge in Qinghai Lake, with the rate of contribution to recovery of the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake of more than 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan Region in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for our country or even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area which controls the extension of the west desert to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan Region and the Qinghai Lake Basin, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biological diversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has published the announcement of no permission of fishing in key water areas such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake this year, to construct comprehensive fishing prohibition in “two-river and one-lake”.

This is the geminid meteor shower shot by An Jiu, a lover of astronomy of Beijing, on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the female celestial bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the female celestial body of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 minor planet, which is an apollo type asteroid.
The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far.
According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science, just as a new year blockbuster, the geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “show time” during December 4 to December 17.
The geminid meteor shower is known for its large size and the stabilization, which is called together with the quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
The significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large amounts of fireballs; which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photographers.

Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be the maximum at about 15:00 on December 14; and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is above the head, the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.
The recommended index chart of the geminid meteor shower.
“In the last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be influenced by the moon light, with the splendid degree slightly influenced.
December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the phase of the moon as the waxing gibbous, and bright moonlight will lead to interference to observation; fortunately, the moon will fail in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher.
People who like meteor showers can observe it in a few of hours after moon falling in the second half of the night, but please keep warm. ”
How to observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is suggested to observe meteor showers not in cities but a place of high altitude with wide view, small light pollution, facing to northeast, and then observe with eyes after the falling of the moon.
It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have large flow on each direction, and do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
People who like photography can select lens with wide angle and large aperture, with high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting, in order to take blockbusters of meteor showers.
By taking stability and sustainability into consideration, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are necessary. ”
