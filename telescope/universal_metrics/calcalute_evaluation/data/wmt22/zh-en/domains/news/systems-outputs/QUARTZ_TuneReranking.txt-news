At the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night, a series of brain-opening achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students.Their research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical science, life science, humanities education, etc.The students have created many high-end inventions with application value from a curious point of view, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Zhang Di-ming, a Ph.D. student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor that is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is take a gentle breath, and the device will make a preliminary assessment of your health from the gaseous components you are exhaling.”
The sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report is displayed on the phone when the gas is exhaled, Zhang Diming said.
There are smart wristwatches on the market that can detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The biosensor, which uses a new material called graphene, targets chemical elements and uses a keen sense of smell to provide a deeper and more accurate picture of a person's health.
Smart Surgery Lamp: Doctors' High-Performance Eyes
In addition to smartphones, the operating room is equipped with smart operating lights.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, graduate students of the Institute of Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, have opened a new way of thinking in the flaws of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
“Many of the early detection and irreversible removal of diseases are related to the lights used in doctors’ operating rooms.”
'For example, in early cancer screening, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread,' Shen said.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of patches at any time, depending on the need for surgery and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tested in Shao Yifu Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: water-saving and stylish
Ordinary people wash their hands by washing with water, rubbing soap on the top, and squeezing hand-washing liquid, while students such as Li Kaizhang invented an “air hand-washing device.”
As long as we stand on the washstand of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and is combined with the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Color-reaction and bacterial residue experiments have shown that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, can guarantee the level of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold prize.

Yesterday, a reporter from the city's Education Commission was informed that starting this year, the city will conduct a pilot "modern apprenticeship" training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training will simultaneously have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees of the units.
In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, students, schools and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements.For students who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, students, guardians, schools and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, contents of teaching and protection of rights and interests of the students being trained.
The pilot schools shall be encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship system in conjunction with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the training model.
Schools and enterprises shall jointly design personnel training programmes and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
Students are required to complete a six-month apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship, and students must complete a six-month apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship
According to the characteristics of different specialties, a master can take two to five apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each pilot numbering about 50 people, a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
We will explore the establishment of long-term effective mechanisms for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated human development of schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of piloting and implementing them first, and gradually advancing them from point to point, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve student-to-student employment rates and the quality of employment.

South African doctor: Omicron transmits strongly but is mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus Omicron variant is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads more rapidly.
A group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Haute-Garonne province reported that they are treating new crown patients with mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughing, similar to influenza, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, the Associated Press reported.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, says he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home,” Pillay said. “Most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation.”
This includes the elderly and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from coronary virus infections, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta outbreaks, he treated new-crown patients with "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report of Omicron mutant strains in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new coronary heart disease patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severe, half the rate in the previous wave; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3% of new coronary heart disease patients died recently, compared to 20% in early-onset cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At present, there are almost all indications that this is a mild disease.”
“It is still early and we need to get the later data,” he said.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into the epidemic.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world's leading new crown virus strain, Omicron cases are occurring in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in the first week of December in the province of Haute-Garonne increased by 400%, with tests showing more than 90% of the cases involving Omikyong mutants.
Educational commentary: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If we compare the well-known public-interest advertising phrase, "There is no killing without buying and selling," then, in a good environment without the need for "abduction," group-prevention, group-management, and nation-wide counter-abduction would make the acts of kidnapping and selling unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes would not happen again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security kidnapped and developed the missing children information emergency release platform online.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
Listening to the app’s name, “Reunification,” I felt warm.
The new technologies are not only called “literature and art,” they are full of emotions, and information technology is used appropriately, practically, and effectively.
Kidnapping law enforcement, the primary objective is to find the kidnapped children, protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be summed up in many broad terms.
However, priority should be given to the victim's personal safety before a kidnapping case is resolved.
The question of whether or not a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether or not a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted
Based on the detection experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the winning.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for more than a minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the detection of the case will be one more difficult.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way to help the detection of cases and the retrieval of children directly, such as a “reunification” platform.
After all, “kidnapping” is a major undertaking that requires the operation of an entire legal system.
Fighting crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the safeguarding of the judiciary, and rigorous enforcement, do not require caring for the "protection of the weak and vulnerable".
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, could be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at the railway station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child missing.
One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have a reasonable sense of protection.
Resting alternately between the two parents or placing the child under proper protection is the least that can be done to prevent the child from being abducted.
From the other side of the police combating the crime of kidnapping and selling, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just a ring in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory punishment for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a more serious crime under the general trend of "minor punishment" with a high penalty point and a maximum penalty.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in their conceptions of child-rearing and lack legal awareness.
Legal education for this segment of the population should be pursued simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the abduction "market" exists widely, if the abductors are motivated by the desire for profit, if they constantly innovate the means of abduction, and if they form a situation of "fighting" with law enforcement officials, the abduction operation will surely fall into an ineffective muddle.
Thus, the elimination of backward notions and the dissemination of legal common sense will also help to eradicate the crime of child abduction and trafficking.
Statement by Yang Hodong at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the Provincial Party Conference
Drawing Strength from the Centennial Struggle History of the Party
According to the unification arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Hodong, made an interactive speech at the Manchukuo Garden in Malangshan, studying in depth the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Congress, studying the spirit of the endorsement of the important instructions given by the President of the People's Republic of China to the keynote speech of Hunan, and studying the spirit of the Twelfth Party Congress of the province.
From the three aspects of ideal conviction and original mission, self-revolution and youth, the leadership of the Party and the theory of the Party, Yang explained the core meanings and practical requirements of the spirit of the General Assembly in depth and systematically, combining his own insight and personal experience.
He pointed out that the spirit of the plenary meeting should be combined with the spirit of the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China to approve the important instructions and the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress to discuss important issues in Hunan, so as to strengthen the defence of the "Two Establishments," realize the consciousness of the "Two Maintenance," the political consciousness, the action consciousness, and steadfastly move forward in the direction guided by the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China.

By 2022, the number of high school graduates in the Beijing region is expected to reach 26.8 million.
Xinhua News Agency (Yangna) reported on December 11 that the number of high school graduates in Beijing is expected to reach 26.8 million in 2022, an increase of 16,000 from last year, according to a video conference held jointly by Beijing Education Commission and Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau.

At the end of the democratic summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Barack Obama and attended by governments and civil-society and private-sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also says he plans to hold the second global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwanese government representative and councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy activist Luo Guanzhong, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how difficult the tasks ahead of us are," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world.”
"Defending democracy requires a concerted effort on the part of society as a whole," Biden said.
He said: “As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to seek power nakedly before the public interest.”
The second day of the “Democracy Summit” focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
It coincides with “International Human Rights Day.”
In his opening remarks on the day, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“The time has come to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
In a pre-recorded video address to the summit, Hong Kong's pro-democracy human rights activist Luo Guanzhong reminded participants of the continuing concerns about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For a long time, the world has been accepting China’s rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil-society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
He also urged the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Communist Party of China.
He said: “Perhaps some of you are afraid to annoy President Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you do not recognize the threat to our democratic values.”
And that's why we failed.
That is why we must change.”
During a roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values,” Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Council, released a video statement emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the struggle against despotism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the new plague through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy continues to flourish, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of decline.
In Taiwan, however, we don’t have to seal the city to control the epidemic; we don’t have to go underground to defeat false information.”
On the second day of the summit, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, that have been found to have violated human rights, as well as restrictions on investment in a Chinese company that has been found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural primary school audio-visual beauty teachers within three years.
Since 2016, Jiangxi province has been planning to train 1 music, art and physical education teacher for every primary school in the province's villages (townships and below) over a three-year period, for a total of 10,000 teachers, in order to strengthen the capacity to safeguard the shortage of teachers in disciplines and achieve balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, Xinhua reported by wire in Nanchang on May 22 (reporter Chen Yushan).
It is understood that this training is aimed at rural primary schools in Jiangxi province who are under 45 years of age, have a knowledge base or talent in music, art and sports subjects, and can also serve as teachers of other subjects in music, art and sports courses.
Through training, we will enable them to master the basic knowledge and teaching skills in the teaching of acoustic aesthetics, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability and self-development ability, build a team of acoustic aesthetics teachers with one-of-a-kind and multi-functional abilities, and alleviate the shortage of rural acoustic aesthetics teachers.
In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi also plans to train one music, art, and physical education teacher in each of the 100 primary schools in the province's counties (cities and districts), with a total of 300 trainees, to improve their teaching demonstration leadership abilities, the ability to design and organize teaching and research activities, the ability to train, the ability to build network training workshops, and to play a role in teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.

A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan an arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gan Dan 'arrow target' for her sister collecting donations" blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan an arrow" written on the board, indicating that pedestrians can use bow and arrow shooting after paying.
The incident sparked controversy among Internet users.
Last night, the head of publicity for the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to reporters in Xinjing that the police confirmed that the girl raised money for her sister to make such an outrageous move, but the behavior is not worth promoting, after warning the girl has left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the Streets "Arrow Target" Fundraising Admonition
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on it in black ink, and in front of another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat account, payment treasure account, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted on the Internet.
Some commentators have called the move “an eye-opening begging act,” and others have expressed sympathy.
“What we found when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd was that there were already a lot of people around.”
In an interview with the local media, police officers at the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stalls, all around 20 years old, dressed up as youthful and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was the "target of human flesh" kept crying, asking passers-by to play the game; the other girl at the side shouted, saying that her friend's sister had leukaemia, now urgently needed surgery, please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, the head of publicity at the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in Xinjing that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, for her sister Ji Jia Yan collected donations.
But with the treatment still costing more than $300,000, it took a while to come up with a good way to raise money.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one responsible for launching, but did not participate in the whole process, no one found an arrow, only someone surrounded and took a photo posted on the microblogging.
After the police were appraised by the security department, the use of bows and arrows did not fall within the scope of regulation.
The person in charge said that “there is no advocacy for this kind of open-ended fundraising.”
After being warned by the police, she left the police station.

This year, the amount of transactions in the national network payment business for the "Shanghai Eleven" Carnival reached 1.7 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
On the other hand, consumers have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", JFTC Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "JFTC") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, rejecting blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index stood at 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
In general, China's residents perform well in the financial consumption level, but there are big differences in the different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
According to Nielsen's China Youth Liabilities Report and CCTV's China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020, the younger generation has enormous potential for consumption, and credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no accumulated debt. While the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, it differs greatly from the label of "excessive expenditure" affixed by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption, consumption behavior that follows the wind, and consumption behavior that follows the wind
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JFTC has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among younger groups, through practical actions.
Over the past several years, JFTC has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities aimed at young people, including university students, and conducted various forms of tacit guidance on the consumption needs of young people, such as launching an innovation practice contest in cooperation with top domestic institutions, to help them establish rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumption needs, thereby helping them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary, JFTC reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid consumption-borrowing misconceptions, in order to avoid affecting personal credit collection and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned ahead of time, and payable on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, JFE Credit will, as always, with its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, bring more appropriate demand and diversified services to consumers, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the idea of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a consumer financial partner that can be trusted by consumers for life.
Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council faces common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions severely affected Haitian internal unity and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward “solidarity and stability” mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of differences among the Gulf Arab states and the restoration of relations with Qatar are demands that must be united in the interests of all nations and in the interests of regional stability, in order to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
A 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries’ companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
His visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the rest of the world on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear program – an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term “competitor,” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia conducted direct negotiations with Iran against the background that the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran failed to satisfy the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first meeting of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
It is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of the unity of the Commonwealth, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
"The Spirit of the University and the Spirit of the Times". www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Spirit of the University and the Spirit of the Times. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of running principles and the pursuit of value accumulated in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present day, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has assumed a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For our university, it arose in the autumn of national danger, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value idea of "Ming Dynasty Jizei, Shu Qi Jiping" and the patriotism of "developing a strong country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, technology competition, and talent competition are intensifying. As an important “supply side,” higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Comprehensive Programme for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Subjects" demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and more up-to-date requirements for university development.
How can we accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class subjects in a relatively short period of time, and achieve the “overtaking of the curve”?
In addition to firm objective self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, a backward advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents overseas, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and realizing a remarkable improvement in academic standards and the quality of running schools; second, a cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated in the five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture in order to consolidate strength, shape brands, and enhance the image; and third, a institutional advantage, by exerting the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthening the objective drive, pooling consensus, and optimizing the allocation of resources, so as to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools
In particular, it should be recognized that the construction of world-class universities is not possible in a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while exerting its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have a common Chinese characteristic, but also reflect their own unique goals, running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we have focused on highlighting three characteristics in running our schools: firstly, we have highlighted the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, built an integrated environment for the integration of science and education and the integration of schools and enterprises, and formed an ecosystem for entrepreneurial education along the entire chain; secondly, we have highlighted the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoted the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, built an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary interchange, actively nurtured cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; and thirdly, we have highlighted the characteristics of running our schools and social services, conducted in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerated the formation of a pan-Zhejiang system
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the university spirit at all times, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the newest system of expression of Zhejiang University’s spirit is composed of the university’s motto, “To seek innovation,” the common values of “ diligence, virtue, discernment, and faithfulness,” and “Hina River, enlightenment, virtue, pioneering people, and our nation.”
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulates a high level of culture and cohesive spiritual strength, and has a rich and far-reaching meaning.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodied in the heart of "the world's talents for me to use" and expressed as the quality idea of drawing on the world-famous schools to run and educate people; "Enlightenment and good morality" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that while the university is pursuing the truth, it should be more subject to the ethics and personality sharpening; "open-minded people" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the search for new knowledge, scientific research and innovation, but also expressed as the reform and development, revolution and revolution; "Tree our nation" emphasizes the
This series of spiritual ideas and pursuit of values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history.
“He who is intelligent hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in the invisible.”
It is time for China's universities and colleges to further build on the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp profoundly the historical orientation of higher education and its historical mission, and accelerate its construction to become the world's first-class universities.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic concern and freedom of independence, and let the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation vibrate with each other, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national wealth and strength, national revival, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

More than 130 Asian groups in the U.S. filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23 to protest the discriminatory admissions practices of Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Educational Union, which brought the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of the top U.S. universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in the top three U.S. universities remains essentially the same, the group's chairman, Zhao Yuqing, said at the conference.
Many studies have shown that these institutions “continuously and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “comprehensive consideration” admissions process.
A 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed Asians had the lowest admission rates among all ethnic groups in the three universities, Zhao said.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrolment ratios for Asian students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice would be able to conduct an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after establishing the facts.
They also hoped that the complained universities would take the issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, three universities have not responded to the complaint.
The Association for Asian Education, founded in 2015, filed a complaint against Harvard University's enrollment discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education denied the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups involved in the complaint, there are also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.
At the end of Friday's "Democracy Summit," China's foreign ministry spokesman said in a speech Saturday (December 11) that the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" was organized by the U.S. "with ideological divisions, the instrumentalization and weaponization of democracy, the practice of pseudo-democracy against the reality of democracy, the incitement of division and confrontation, and the transfer of internal contradictions."
The Chinese government believes, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, carried out 'democratic transformation,' abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a 'color revolution,' with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for US intervention in other countries.
The summit was a step toward fulfilling Biden's campaign promises.
The two-day conference, held on video, was attended by 111 world leaders, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia accused the United States of having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Doubts have been expressed both internationally and within the United States, for example, by critics of invited leaders, including leaders of authoritarian countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and by some who doubt that the Biden administration's real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical rather than democratic purposes.
Early German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also attended the video democracy summit
China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that “American democracy is becoming increasingly ill-healthy today, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, party rivalries, political polarization, social divisions, ethnic conflicts, and the division of rich and poor.”
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to better withstand the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest,” US President Barack Obama said in a speech.
He emphasizes that democracy is not something that can be taken for granted, “we must continually update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The U.S. pledged to launch a one-year, $424.4 billion initiative after the summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies before a summit on substantive democracy is scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let us all deliver on our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
Educational Thinking: How the University Examination Lets "Level One" "Level Two" "Level Three" "Level Four" "Level Five" "Level Five" "Level Six" "Level Seven" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Six" "Level Seven" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Seven" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Seven" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Seven" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight" "Level Eight
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the head of the university, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the examination question type, so that the examination really reflects the student's actual level of aspiration.
Indeed, university exams have long been a “hot topic.”
On the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with varying levels of ability, plus varying degrees of study and learning situations.
There are inevitably different feelings when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, repetition rates are high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on assaults before the exam. If you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve the effect of doing half as much work.
In this way, “study leftovers” can pass or even get high marks if they don’t spend as much as they should; “study bullies” never drop out of classes, have good homework, good notes, and don’t score as much on exams as they do on the “strange status quo.”
Thus, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems existing in the university examination is not without reason, and believe that the situation does not only exist in Lanzhou University.
In this sense, praise should be given to the three students who wrote the letter to Chen.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that the phenomenon of hastily preparing for the examination, thinking of various ways to "appropriate" the examination questions from the teacher, striving to delineate the scope of the examination, seeking to get "key guidance" before the examination is not uncommon, even in the examination with a small copy, asking the teacher to raise his hand after the examination is not surprising.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guideline, the measurement of whether a university examination is successful or not lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
When entering the undergraduate stage, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many of the specialized courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge of a subject thoroughly is the content of the university examination.
And the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject, from the point of knowledge, the space of change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, “The basics of university mathematics 20 years ago are still being studied, or the focus.”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not represent a single examination question type, repeated examination questions.
In many universities, examination papers are usually composed of a set of questions, then co-ordinated by senior teachers of the subject, and examination papers are read by all teachers in charge of the subject, so as to overcome the problem of repetition of the examination papers to some extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions in accordance with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to present a normal distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, it is also necessary to master the teaching situation comprehensively, comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so as to make the test propositions to the difficulty and the problem type dynamically grasp, can highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, at the same time to the problem type to carry out innovative design.
The examination is the commanding rod of university education, what kind of examination, the students will have the corresponding preparation program, will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The faculty of Lanzhou Jiao University attaches great importance to the student's letter of recommendation and has deployed a reform program throughout the university.
Teaching units shall be required to organize teachers to carry out research and self-examination of course-ending examinations, formulate examination questions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and examination of examination questions and examination links, fine-tune the assessment of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all links of course teaching.
Of course, it is necessary to put in place a corresponding system, but kung fu is expensive in everyday life, it requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, eat through both heads, teaching and learning will be better connected, form a benign interaction, the examination will be more in line with the reality, thus allowing "study bully" and "study residue" to get their way.
Special anti-counterfeiting paper for 3,200 newborn babies
(API Newswire) The Sabah National Registry says it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October due to the use of special counterfeit paper stockpiles, affecting an estimated 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Keru Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had been recorded in the system and would be re-issued when the forgery-proof papers arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained a ten-month-long report by a web-based media outlet on the printing of raw paper for Sabah newspapers.
He said the problem arose two months ago and that Sarawak faces the same problem.
“One reason is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing delays in arriving in China.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah was different from that used in other areas and therefore could not be borrowed from stocks held by other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on the 8th, he said.
“The bureau will be dispatched to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for final printing, estimated to take two more working days (December 20) to deliver to the applicants.”
“We will notify applicants to go to the local branch offices to collect their report cards.”
He added that Sabah had issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

The achievement of these achievements is the result of the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the result of the scientific guidance of the Chinese People's Political Declaration and Strategy, and the result of the combined efforts and hard work of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party.
Practice has once again proved that the Party has established the core of the Party Central Committee of Comrade Xi Jinping and the core of the entire Party, and has established the guiding position for the development of the Chinese Communist Party and its undertakings in a new era, which is of decisive significance to the development of the Party and its undertakings in a new era and to the historical process of promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China as the core of the CPC Central Committee, the leadership of the entire Party, the scientific guidance for the development of the Chinese Communist Party, and the unity and tenacity of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and create a new era of splendour and a new historical great achievement on the new quest of building a socialist and modernized country in an all-round manner.
The 20th Party Congress will be convened next year, which is an important event in the political life of the Party and the country.
To carry forward the great spirit of the founding Party, to adhere to the overall tone of the work of steady progress, to fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, to accelerate the construction of the new development pattern, to open up the reform process of economic development, to adhere to innovation-driven development, to promote the development of economic development, to adhere to supply-side structural reform as the main line, to coordinate epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, to coordinate development and security, to continue to do well in the "six-steady" and "six-guarantee" work, to continuously improve people's livelihoods, to work hard to stabilize the macroeconomic system, to keep the economy operating within a reasonable range, and to keep the social situation stable, we will surely be able to maintain a stable and healthy

Educational Information: Beijing compressed the proportion of students with special needs enrolled in primary and secondary schools at the beginning of 2016.
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of specialized students enrolled in Beijing junior high school was carried out by the unified organization of the faculty committees of each district.
This year, Beijing's districts have reduced the enrollment ratio of special-needs students, and the competition for special-needs students has become more intense.
Taking the Dongcheng District as an example, this year the enrollment rate of primary and junior high school specialized students in the district as a whole does not exceed 5% of the enrollment rate of the entire district, the planned enrollment number is 380 people, and the enrollment rate does not exceed 10% of the school enrollment rate.
All students who have specialized in sports, art, science and technology and register on-line are eligible to participate in the Admissions Examination for Specialized Students.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, set "buffer zone" State Council Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism issued a statement requesting to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control
Xinhua News Agency (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiansheng) said on December 11 that the State Council's Joint Defense and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the control and prevention of pneumonia outbreaks in port cities, requiring people who recently leave land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold negative certificates for testing nucleic acid within 48 hours and carry out at least one test of nucleic acid after arriving at land border port cities.
According to the notification, the time scope of the above-mentioned requirement shall be from the date on which the port city scope is determined and announced by the provinces and municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the Notice also states that conditional port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides frequently visit each other, the head of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the State Health Commission said.
By implementing a policy of differentiated management of sub-divisions, from one line of outbreak prevention and control to two lines of prevention and control, it is hoped that the frontier will be moved forward, the risk of outbreak prevention and control will be reduced, and maximum effectiveness in outbreak prevention and control will be achieved at the lowest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many cases of indigenous aggregation epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice points out that this exposes the following problems: inadequate early warning and monitoring of local epidemics, inadequate implementation of closed-circuit management by high-risk personnel, regular flow of nucleic acid testing, inadequate killing of cold chain items, inappropriate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and accurate emergency management of epidemics.
According to the notification, nine aspects such as improving the mechanism for preventing and controlling epidemics in port cities, improving the system for monitoring and early warning of epidemics, and implementing border control measures will be pursued.
The Notice emphasizes that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control as well as work on the protection of the people's livelihood, announce and open the hotline for the protection of the people's livelihood, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic necessities of life, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the people.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where the open land, water and air ports are located, the cities (territories, states, unions) where they are located and the cities directly under the Central Government.
"Twenty Years of U.S. Bloodshed".
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "The Killing Machine" was released on the oil pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exported American-style democracy through war, spent 20 years in the hands of poor soldiers, committed crimes against humanity such as bloodlust, murdering innocent people, and committing crimes against humanity.
Abuse of unmanned aerial vehicles in civilian areas such as hospitals and schools, distortion of humanity, and formation of killing groups.
Over the past two decades, US troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The Americans set up a "black prison" to inflict torture and humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity incites hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terror” war is “more anti-terror than terror.”
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless massacres.
Poke the video, let's uncover the truth of America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism," poke the hypocrisy of American democracy!
"Don't scare people on the runway".
When you go to the bookstore, you can often feel the explosion of success-oriented books.
Many of today’s success books advocate “best principles” – that is, assuming or implying that you can “do it,” and then telling you “what” you need to do.
It's like saying that we've gone beyond the "how to do" part of the process, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
That’s why these books have one thing in common: either you do the best you can, or you just don’t do anything; either you’re 100, or you’re 0; or you’re climbing Mount Tai, or you’re just staying where you are.
This “best principle” is recognized as “excellently correct” by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people are scared to death in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “making up your mind, reinventing yourself, coming to a 180-degree transformation,” which is precisely the fatal weakness of many.
To a man who abides by the rules, obeys the old, and refuses to change, you must yell in his ear, “You must change,” and it is certainly self-deceiving, like playing the ox’s harp.
The overwhelming majority of people will shy away from the word "transformation" and struggle to make up their minds. Or, with a momentary impulse, they will make up their minds to "transform," and bravely take the first step.
The echo of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow onwards" is the most iconic expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the “best principles” is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people’s abilities, for the vast majority of people to “look up and sigh.”
Perhaps the “second best” principle is the only way to get more ordinary people onto the path to relative success.
At the heart of the “second-best principle” is “reducing the threshold” – which encourages a “win-win-win” theory, i.e., if you can’t do 100, you can only do one: because one is always greater than zero; if you can’t climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the little sand dunes at your doorstep, because that’s always better than walking.
Anyway, if you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is much more chance for ordinary people to stick to it, and the probability of success increases as long as they stick to it.
The road to success simply follows the “second best” principle, and is a little longer.
In short, the “best principle,” while ostensibly a banner of success for all, can ultimately inspire, in fact, only a few; and the “second-best principle,” can effectively inspire more people, benefiting as many as possible.
The amount of raw carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year.
Xinhua news agency reported by wire in Xining on December 11 (reporters Lock Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons, more than 40 times the cumulative increase compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, popularly known as Huang Yu, is a unique species of precious fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the water-fish-bird ecosystem and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to factors such as large-scale human kills and the increasingly degraded environment in the naked carp breeding waters.
In 2004, the naked carp of Lake Qinghai was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented sealed-off fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals to fish for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificially breeding and releasing the carp, clearing the main inflow channels into the lake, and designing scientifically reasonable fish passageways.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that so far, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake has been artificially propagated and released nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai-Sanjiang source area is an important ecological barrier and water reservoir area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai-Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year Qinghai has successively issued Notices of Prohibition of Catching in the Key Waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake.

Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new crown mutant Omicron virus, Xinhua reported.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron poisoning for the first time on October 10.
One infected person was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November, and another was a Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa, according to Malawian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal.
After hospital isolation treatment, both infected patients turned negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on October 10 that it had confirmed for the first time three cases of Omicron poisoning in the country.
All three of them were students who had returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. All of them were mildly ill and had not been admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron poisoning, the Seychelles government has steadily increased its efforts to prevent and control it.
From December 6 to January 10, passengers over the age of 12 travelling by air will be required to have their nucleic acid tested at the airport at their own expense.
The ministry also announced on October 10 that it would start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the new Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Konbise Chibanda, said on Sunday that the country had first detected three cases of Omicron poisoning.
The country's health ministry conducted genome sequencing of 12 new crown-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.
There are about ~ Gemini meteor showers on the 14th will usher in a great - wikipedia
As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who like it will be able to observe it at midnight later that day, Xinhua news agency said.
A meteor shower in the constellation Gemini was photographed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018 by Beijing astronomer An Jiu.
Most of the meteor shower's parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is Phoebus 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known not to have been "borne" by a comet.
Shu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on the science of astronomy, said the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, just like the Happy New Year movie, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and together with the quadrangle meteor shower and the Persei meteor shower, it is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of Gemini meteor showers is the slow velocity, rich color, and abundance of Martian meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography by beginners.
Tianjin City astronomer Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Jizhou.
Astronomers predict that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is just above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions).
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
"Last year's brilliant Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight and the spectacularity will be reduced a little.
The 14th day of the lunar calendar is November 11, the phase of the moon is convex, bright moonlight can interfere with the observation, well in the middle of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower also rises relatively high.
Friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but watch out for cold and heat.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, an open view to the northeast, and then wait patiently after the moon has set for visual observation.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor showers in all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to look at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor showers while observing.
If you like photography and want to shoot a beautiful ' meteor shower ', it is best to choose a wide angle, large aperture lens, use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential for stability and sustainability.”
Shu Lipeng reminded.
