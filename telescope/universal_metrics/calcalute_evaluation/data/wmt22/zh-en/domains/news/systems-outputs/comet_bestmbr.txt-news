Students play leading roles in Zhejiang University academic annual meeting; the results are eye-opening-Xinhua
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were praised last night.
The principal researchers of these results are students, whose research has covered major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, healthcare, life sciences, and humanistic education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: your home health examiner
Zhang Diming's team, a PhD student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to breathe out lightly, and this device can detect the health condition of the body from the composition of the air you exhale."
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets available on the market that can detect health status typically measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The new biosensor uses graphene as a target material. Its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the body's health status in a more profound and precise way.
Smart surgical lights: the high-energy eyes of doctors
Besides smartphones, smart lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of graduate students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronics Sciences and Engineering opened up new ideas for the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“The early detection and ineffective resection of many diseases are related to the lights used in doctors’ operating rooms.”
Shen Junfei said that if the doctors can not see all tumor tissues in time during initial examination of cancer for example, the cancer cells may spread afterward.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that can improve the differentiation of different tissues under illumination through adjusting spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness rate of the light spot at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of smart operating lamp has been trialled in hospitals such as the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and received good feedback.
The invention won first prize at the National Challenge Cup in October last year.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, using at most some soap or liquid hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other classmates invented a “air handwashing device”.
Once we stand on the bathroom sink, our body weight compresses the air.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms fluid at the faucet, where it combines with the water.
In this way we can wash our hands clean!”
Experiments on color reaction and bacterial residue proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only has to rely on our own gravity as driving force, which can ensure cleaning and save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second global Grand Challenges summit, this invention came to the fore among many top universities in the world and received the only gold award.
Chongqing vocational schools are experimenting with modern apprenticeship system
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will trial the "modern apprenticeship based" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and students who have received the trial training will also have apprenticeship status.
The municipal education commission requests that secondary vocational school enrollment and enterprise employment procedures should be standardized, and that apprentices should have double identities of vocational school students绕
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern apprenticeship and work with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-employment and transfer training for their employees.
Pilot schools should reform their talent training modes.
Schools and enterprises shall jointly design talent cultivation programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, management standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program functions as a trial period, in which the student's internship period at the enterprise is determined according to the professional personnel training plan. The working experience on the post is usually 6 months.
According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead two to five apprentices to form study groups, making sure that students learn the skills required by each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with around 50 personnel in each pilot project, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
Based on the principle of implementing pilot projects first, then moving forward step by step, we have explored and established a long-term mechanism featuring joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated education among schools and enterprises. These will effectively enhance students’ job skills, and improve their counterpart employment rate and job quality.
China Children's Center will launch a series of activities to make children "high-tech" through "July 1"_Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20. (Huang Xiaoxi, Zhou Shanshan) The reporter learned from the China Children's Center on the 20th that from May 28 to June 1, around the Children's Day, the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as children's maker experience, children's visual arts festival, and parent-child book carnival, allowing children to enjoy the charm of cutting-edge technology.
It is understood that the activities held during the Children’s Day of June 1st this year included the “Love Your Family”, the Future Learning Carnival for Children, the First Children’s Visual Arts Festival, or the “Book Carnival” activity, and “Family reads with pictures”.
Li Zhongming, the deputy director of the China Children's Center, introduced at the media briefing for the 2016 Children's Day on June 20 that the "Kids' Everlasting Learning" is a key event this year at the Children's Center.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission but most cases are mild
Many South African scholars and medical experts believe that the mutated coronavirus, Omicron, causes milder symptoms than the delta variant although it spreads faster.
A group of more than 5,000 physicians formed in South Africa’s Gauteng province reported that patients they currently treat have mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughs, much like the flu, according to The Associated Press.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but none of them have yet required hospitalization.
“They were able to manage the disease at home and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of being quarantined,” Pillay said.
This includes elderly patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk to become seriously affected by coronavirus, he said.
By comparison, he said during the last Delta virus outbreak, the patients he treated with the virus had "difficulty in breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a matter of days.”
In the two weeks after the first reports of the mutated Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will still be several weeks before enough data is gathered, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of patients hospitalized in recent weeks with coronavirus are severe cases, half of that of the previous outbreak. The average length of stay has shortened from 8 to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent coronavirus patients have died, compared with 20% in the early outbreak of cases in South Africa.
"At present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: “It’s still early days and we need to get data in later days.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur relatively late and we're only two weeks into this wave.”
In the meantime, scientists across the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's predominant strain of coronavirus, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases identified in the first week of December, with tests showing the omicrone variant comprising more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Education Times Review: What can I do to save abducted children?
If we use the analogy of the famous saying of “No buying, no killing”, then, in a magnificent environment where there is no demand for “abduction”, mass prevention and fight against abductions by all people will make trafficking unprofitable, with high risks and high costs, and then this type of crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for the release of information on missing children and for timely retrieval of abducted children.
When I heard this App named "Reunion", I felt a lot of warmth immediately.
New technologies are not only full of sense and inspiration in their names, but also can embody the prudent application of informatization in a practical and effective manner.
The primary goal of enforcement of the law against abduction is to retrieve the kidnapped children and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The next step is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated in many “big words”.
Before abduction and trafficking cases are solved, however, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
For the urgent purpose of “search for help,” many controversial topics, such as “whether abducting children should be condemned to death”, can be put aside temporarily, and they can be discussed with caution; but the rescue of the kidnapped children cannot wait.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leave a crime location as soon as possible after they have succeeded.
If the kidnapping operation delays one minute longer, the child may be further separated from its parents and the difficulty in solving a case will increase by one degree.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective approaches like the “Reunion” platform that will directly help detect cases and retrieve children.
After all, “inhibiting abduction” is a major task that requires the functioning of the entire legal system.
The improvement of legislation, judicial protection and rigorous law enforcement in combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of the children and their parents require “caring for the young and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, both at home and in society, could be done better.
For example, a common case is a family of three resting in a train station, and the parents were asleep and woke up to find that the child was missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old to possess adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of younger children, at least a fair degree of protection should be achieved.
Taking breaks for both parents, or keeping children under secure protection, are the minimum means of preventing child abductions.
From the perspective of the police's fight against abduction and trafficking, the side that buys kidnapped children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single unlawful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions in China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for child trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may include death and property confiscation.
Under the general trend of “light punishment”, the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is clearly a offence with heavier punishments.
Yet, there are still many cases of human trafficking that happen every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts about raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this part of the people should be followed up simultaneously
In order to effectively control human trafficking crimes, officials cannot rely solely on strict enforcement of the law.
If there is a widespread "market" for abduction and traffickers, they will continuously innovate their tactics to induce a fight against law enforcement. The campaign to prevent the abduction will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Thus, eradicating outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eliminate the crime of kidnapping, selling and bribing children.

Summit on democracy ended and Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and an authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he planned to hold a second global democracy summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: “We know just how tough the job ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet that challenge because, as I've said before, democracy is everywhere, as this summit has demonstrated.
Autocracies can never extinguish the flickering fire of freedom which is burning in the hearts of people worldwide and in all corners of the earth.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and drive reforms for transparent and accountable governance, one that is more resilient to authoritarian buffers and shocks and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
The main themes on the second day of the Democracy Summit included defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with “International Human Rights Day”.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including exploiting all the tools afforded by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong-based pro-democracy and human rights activist Eric Law spoke to the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants of the ongoing concern regarding human rights conditions in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without putting in place a mechanism to hold it accountable,” he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use whatever [resources] we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China (CCP).
"Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you do not recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
Taiwan’s executive council member, Tang Feng, published a “National Statement” via video and emphasized that Taiwan is in the forefront of opposing autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the coronavirus outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when democracy in Taiwan is just emerging, we remain a firm leader in the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide," the president said.
We are seeing signs of retreating democracy around the world as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without shutting down our cities, and we can defeat false information without removing them.”
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the US Treasury Department announced legally the sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries including China and North Korea that had been identified as violating human rights.

Girl used as an archery target to raise money for her sister: “It will be OK if I imagine it's a skin injury” - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to serve as a "target" for her sister to collect donations" exploded in their circles of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a larger wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square with words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written on the board, indicating that the passersby can use bow and arrow to shoot, after payment.
This behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer from the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News that the police had made such radical actions after they believed that the girl was raising money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth encouraging. After being cautioned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
A school girl was admonished to collect donations from street “target”
In the images uploaded on the Internet, a girl with long hair was standing in front of a large wooden board with a font of “a”.
The image sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "begging behavior that attracts attention", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
“We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the plaza at around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a number of onlookers at that time.”
In an interview with local media, policemen from Tianshui police station near the incident said that there are two girls in the shop; they are both around 20 years old and are beautifully dressed.
One of the girls was crying, and begging passerby to play this game; a girl said, "My friend's sister was diagnosed with leukemia, and is urgently needing surgery, please help."
“We got in contact with local police in Guizhou and learned that this girl was raising donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, a publicity officer from Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from The Beijing News that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, this action was done because the treatment still cost over 300,000 yuan and we could not think of a good way to raise donations for the time being.
He said that one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for the attack, but they were not involved in the whole process, and no one was found shooting any arrows. Some people were watching and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
The police identified the use of bows and arrows by the public security departments were not in the regulated scope.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate the use of this kind of online donation-raising method".
After being warned by people at the police station, she has already left the police station.
Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of Double Twelve - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
The transaction volume of online payment business across China reached 1.77 trillion yuan during this year's "Double Eleven" carnival, hitting a new high compared to previous years.
On one hand, some people sigh that the consumption force of citizens has become stronger; On the other hand, they must calmly consider how consumerism will affect society and the current mainstream consumers.
On the eve of the “Double Twelve”, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Home Credit) advocated rational consumption, reminding users, especially the young people, to foster good consumption awareness and habits and refuse to spend blindly and excessively.
The survey on consumer financial literacy published this year by the People's Bank of China found that the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, a 2.04-point increase compared to 2019.
In general, Chinese residents are performing well in terms of financial consumption, but there are huge differences in financial behaviors and skills, and further enhancement of basic financial knowledge is necessary.
The elderly and young people have a relatively low financial literacy level and will remain the focus of financial education. Nielsen’s “Report on the Status of Young People Debt in China” and the “2019-2020 Young People’s Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance showed that the young generation has enormous consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Half of them have no debt accumulation.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has always dedicated itself to providing high-quality and caring services to help people build their own happy lives, advocated consumer awareness of consumption and responded positively to regulatory calls to take action to enhance consumers, especially young people's awareness of rational consumption.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously implemented a variety of diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including university students, and has also taken a subtle approach to guide the consumption needs of young people in a variety of ways. It helps them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan their consumption needs, and helps them accumulate life wealth.
When Double Twelve comes, Home Credit reminds all consumers to have a reasonable consumption awareness and correct outlook on money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings about consumer loans so as not to affect personal credit and economic living in the future.
Be sure to plan ahead when making purchases and repay your payments on time according to your ability.
Overdue information will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse impacts on economic life such as car purchasing and housing purchases in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verify whether relevant institutions have operating credentials.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products, to provide consumers with more suitable and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, and help consumers develop rational consumption.
NDO: GCC meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, it is the first visit by Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017 which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties and imposed a blanket embargo on Qatar amid the crisis, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity within the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked air, sea and land routes to Qatar
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “solidarity and stability”.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors from both countries in Qatar.
Resolving differences among Gulf Arab countries to restore relations with Qatar stems from a demand for unity to address common challenges in the interests of countries and regional stability.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land route between the two neighboring Gulf countries.
The 725 km-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and integrate supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The visit by the Saudi crown prince to Gulf countries coincides with Iran negotiating with world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as JCPOA, an agreement that Gulf Arab states condemned as failing to resolve the missile issue with Tehran.
Various Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threatre to regional security".
Various Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and inaction to curb Iran’s activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran amid the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf nations in their nuclear negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to contain escalation in tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that are slowing down economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first meeting of GCC countries since a dispute between some member states with Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, and to propose measures that make its member countries fully cooperate with each other in meeting common challenges and contributing towards the stability and development of the Gulf states.
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times on the same frequency-Xinhua News Agency
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated for a long time in the development process of a institution, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to today, the university spirit has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first university in the modern sense in the world, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. Chinese universities arose during a time of national crisis and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of “fine virtue, social justice and peace,” and the patriotic responsibility to “revive science and strengthen our country.”
Currently, the trend toward informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. Global competition in education, technology and talent has intensified. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for Coordinating the Development of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" preserves China's confidence and determination to be a country with higher education, and it also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How can we endeavor to become one of the world's first-class bodies in a relatively short time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, with certain gaps still there?
Apart from its confidence in goals, paths and ability, higher education institutions should fully utilize three advantages: firstly, they can play respect to the latecomers, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to greatly improve their academic level and quality of their education; secondly, cultural advantages are to inherit the wisdom and connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization over the past five thousand years, carry forward great traditional culture, to build strengths, build brands and enhance their image; thirdly, the system advantage: exercise the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal driving, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable way for schools to super Institutionalize the advanced world level in order to meet the world leading level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in one form, and all schools must manifest their individuality and characteristics while taking advantage of their strengths.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have Chinese characteristics in common, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we emphasize three characteristics in running a school: first, to highlight the innovative and entrepreneurial talent development characteristics, building a comprehensive educational environment incorporating the integration of science and education and school-enterprise fusion, and to form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, to highlight the characteristics of intersecting and converging disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate intersecting emerging disciplines and iconic crossover achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of university running system and social services, and establishing in-depth exchanges and cooperation between industries, universities, and research institutes, accelerating the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important that we always adhere to the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “Seeking truth and innovation”, common values of “Restraints, practicing morality, discernment, and steadfastness” together form the latest system of expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction, continue to accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual power. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
“Hina Janghe" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, which embodies the big-hearted values "people in the world can use it for me", and is reflected as the high quality concept of running a school and educating people in the world.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the essence of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of academic operation.
"The intelligent hears the silent, and the enlightened see痕迹 the invisible."
Chinese universities should further focus on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the current position of higher education and the historic mission shouldered by it, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanities and freedom. We should let the spirit of the university encourage others to produce greater national prosperity and revitalization, as well as to realize the common ideal of mankind.
Iranian president: Iran nuclear talks likely to reach agreement if sanctions lifted
Iran's President Raisi said in Tehran on December 11 that negotiation in the Iran nuclear issue can produce a "good deal" if sanctions on Iran are lifted.
According to news released by the Iranian President's website, Rahi said yesterday during a meeting with Iranian envoys in neighboring countries that Iran has proved its sincerity in negotiations by submitting proposals to other parties involved in the nuclear agreement.
If the US side is determined, “the path to reaching an agreement will be smooth.”

Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and three other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, reported on May 23 that more than 130 Asian-American groups in the US filed complaints with the US Department of Education and Justice in protest against the discrimination of Asian American applicants by three prestigious Ivy League schools in Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which had raised the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
In the last 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of American elite universities has doubled, but in these three leading American schools, the percentage of Asian Americans has remained basically the same.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges “persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “universal” admissions processes.
A research conducted by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in the three universities, Asian people have the lowest admission rate of any ethnic group relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate the matter and take steps to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after a complaint is filed.
They also expect that the colleges receiving complaints will take the initiative to take this issue into consideration and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities involved in the complaint have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian American Education Alliance lodged a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, those involved in this complaint also include educational groups from Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani individuals in the United States.
(Deutsche Welle) China’s foreign ministry spokesman said Saturday (December 11) that in a statement after the “Democracy Summit” concluded, the U.S. is "drawing lines with ideology and instrumentalizing and weaponizing democracy, turning it against the reality of democracy, inciting division and confrontation and diverting domestic conflicts in the name of fake democracy."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and belief on others, implemented 'democratic reform', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions and initiated a 'color revolution', with devastating results."
'Democracy' has long since become a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the United States to interfere with other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting, conducted by video link, was attended by leaders of 111 countries in the world, including leaders from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US for issues with democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically, there are also skeptical voices who criticize the leaders of some countries with authoritarian tendencies, like those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration has organized its summit not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the Digital Democracy Summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday that "the American-style democracy is pathological today, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social separation, racial conflicts, and polarization between rich and poor becoming more and more serious". Democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in a speech, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and become more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good.”
He stresses that democracy is not something taken for granted: "We must constantly renew it across every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said democracies around the world “need fighters to defend as there are ongoing and worrisome challenges to democracy and human rights.”
The United States has pledged to launch a yearlong effort following the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news outlets.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improving their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit scheduled in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on progress we've made through the next year."
Educational thinking: How university exams allow "scholars" and "scumbags" to each have their own place - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiao Tong University wrote letters to school leaders, expressing their confusion about college examinations, and raised demands to raise the exam difficulty and change the pattern of test questions to truly reflect the students' actual proficiency.
Indeed, college exams have long been a“hot topic”.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, and learning levels are extremely variable.
It is inevitable that there will be differing feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are monotonous with a high repetition rate, or the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a different feeling.
Students who don't practice can pass the exam without focusing, but if they find other ways, they may be able to achieve more with less effort.
In this way, "students" can pass exams without any investment, and even score high; "students" never give up classes, keep good assignments, notes, and test scores.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University report that problems existing in University exams are not without reason, and it is believed that Lanzhou Jiaotong University is not alone in such a situation.
In this sense, I would like to give my compliments to these three students who wrote letters honestly.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that it’s not uncommon to rush to prepare for exams, think of all sorts of ways to “get” exam questions from teachers, try to limit the scope of exams, and get “key tuition” before exams.
In my view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, evaluating the pass of a university exam depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific propositions based on them.
Entering into undergraduate stages, majors are beginning to be subdivided, and many major courses mainly focus on basic knowledge.
It is needless to say that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject is what the university exam must examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is based on the basic theories and common sense of the subject. From the perspective of knowledge, there is not much space for change and is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "Basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned now, and that is the key point."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged and it does not mean that the exam questions are of single type and repetitive.
In many universities, the examinations are usually composed of question groups. The exam papers are organized by senior teachers in the subject, and all teachers tasked with the subject work in the grading of examination papers. In this way, the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, a set of exam questions that conform to the actual situation of teaching and learning should be drawn up, and the questions should be arranged in a normal distribution based on the overall situation of students’ learning and the necessity to comprehensively master the teaching situation, and comprehensively analyze the level of students’
Exams are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plan for any kind of exam, and if things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letters of advice from students and has deployed rectification plans across the school.
Every teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and course-end self-examination, formulate examination papers and corresponding frameworks, strengthen the security of procurement and examination, and refine the assessment of achievement levels, and strengthen the overall evaluation of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of test questions and duplication of questions is a topic that university examinations must face. Of course it is necessary to introduce appropriate systems, but it is expensive in daily life. Teachers must have overall understanding of the teaching situation. It is necessary to not only understand teaching contents, but also students' learning situation.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah are without birth certificate because special anti-counterfeiting paper is out of stock
Kota Kinabalu: The Sabah National Registration Department said that, due to the shortage of special security papers, it was unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October and the number of affected people has reached 3200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerou Aminus, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference in response to an online media report that the issue of printing birth certificates in Sabah had been a problem for 10 months.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing this same issue.
“One reason is that Chinese manufacturers that produced special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the virus, causing delay of their delivery to our country.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from other regions, so no goods can be borrowed from other states.
Cairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was subsequently handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to pick up the product in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and return to Sabah for immediate final printing. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicants in two more working days (December 20)."
“We will notify applicants to go to local branch offices to collect birth certificates.”
He added that Sabah had issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far in this year.

The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a notice recently on strengthening the prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia in port cities, requiring that persons who have recently left land border port cities (except those with ports connected with Hong Kong and Macau) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who have traveled to land border port cities will undertake at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date each province, region and city determines and announces the city limits of ports, through to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that eligible port cities may examine the setting up of buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant official from the National Health Commission’s Disease Prevention and Control Agency said for some port cities, cross-border trade is the mainstay of the local economy, and people at the border from both sides communicate frequently.
Implementing regional differentiated management policies has changed from one line of defense against spillovers to two, and is expected to move the barrier forward, reduce the risk of outbreak spillover, and achieve the greatest results in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impacts and low social costs.
There have been several clustered local outbreaks in China recently, all of which were imported from overseas via port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed issues such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, routine nucleic acid tests, inefficient sanitization of refrigeration sources and poor management of centralized isolation sites, and lack of scientific precision in emergency response to the outbreak.
The notification requires that efforts should be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms of port cities, improving epidemic monitoring and early warning systems, and implementing border control measures to expedite efforts to fill in weak spots in the prevention and control of port cities.
All port cities should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with precautionary measures, publicize and preserve hotlines for the protection of people's livelihood, and regularly investigate potential hidden dangers in the supply and prices of basic necessaries, so as to promptly resolve and proactively respond to serious problems raised by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities include the cities (regions, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) according to epidemic prevention and control needs and promptly announced.
YouTube video shows the truth about the bloodthirsty killings of the US military in the past 20 years-Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on YouTube generated widespread attention titled “Killing Machine.”
The film narrates that the US initiated the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. For 20 years, the United States has resorted to violence, bloodlust, killing innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The use of drones to air raids on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and promotes the establishment of killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" and imposed all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity fed more hatred among the Afghans
As stated in the video, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war becomes “more aggressive the more terrorists are being confronted.”
The war has not brought hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
So let us expose the truth about bloodthirsty massacres that take place in the United States in the name of "counter terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wherever you are in a book market, you can often feel the popularity of books about successful learning.
In today’s success books, many promote “best practices”—assuming or implying that you can “do it,” and then telling you what to do.
It means that we have completely skipped the most important and fundamental link in “how to do it”.
For this reason, these books have one thing in common -- either just do your best or do nothing; either 100 or 0; either you ascend mount or you stay put.
This "best principle" will be admitted by anyone who sees it as "extremely correct", but 99% of the people will be intimidated at the starting line.
This is because this theory advocates a path that says "you must make a decision to make a change in your life, start 180 degrees of transformation", which is a fatal weakness in many people.
For people who stick to conventions, adhere to old traditions and refuse change, you just shout in his ear "you need to change", which is undoubtedly a feat.
The vast majority of people appear timid in the face of the word "change" and hesitate to make a decision. Or, they make the decision to make "change" on a whim, and take the first step bravely.
Ma Sanli's famous cross talk in “Starting From Tomorrow” is a classic that most vividly expressed the “universal human nature.”
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, and therefore makes most people get appalled.
Perhaps the “second best principle” is one route that can potentially put more ordinary people on a path of relative success.
The main point of the “second best principle” is to lower the threshold—it encourages a theory of “small wins for bigger wins”, that is, if you can’t do 100, only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0;
In all, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere. As long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the path to success following the "second best principle" is just slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle" on the surface is supposed to let everyone succeed, but it ultimately inspires only a few; and the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.
reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
The new monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,100 tons (up to 108,500 tons) this year compared to the previous year, a 40-fold increase compared to the initial period of protection in 2002.
The common name of naked carp in Qinghai Lake is “Huang Yu”. It is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological chain security and biodiversity of Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human intervention, as well as the deterioration of the breeding water environment for naked carp, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Species in China" in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed lakes to breed fish and prohibited any units, groups and individuals from catching naked carps in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, efforts to protect the water have been continuously strengthened by measures such as artificial enhancement and release, cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake and designing scientifically reasonable fish passages, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Agriculture and Rural Department, indicated that up to now, nearly 180 million carp had been artificially proliferated and released, and had contributed over 23% to the recovery of the carp resources of Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers source region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area controlling the westward spreading desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the headwaters of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain biodiversity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued the prohibition on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake this year.
Fourteenth provincial tea expo opens
Hunan Daily, December 10th (English reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition will showcase the tea industry, innovate technologies, promote tea culture and accelerate the development of the 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Prof. Liu Zhonghua, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, brilliantly introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of Huhong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "Multicolor Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted efforts to set up the high-quality tea industry in Hunan and established the development pattern of “Sanxiang, four waters, and five-color tea”.
Major tea efforts such as green tea, dark tea and black tea have been ongoing, and key tea-producing regions have also promoted the integration of tea and tourism that has led to higher incomes for the tea growers.
Feng Shui changes in turn, and the black tea exerts its strength again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers are able to earn income all year round, and the production value of tea plantations has soared.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded a license for the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan black tea".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a alpine tea called “Bing Lichun”, and placed orders immediately.
The secretary of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Zhun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market more or less, but there were many bright spots at the Expo 2019.
The Xinhua Black Tea with a touch of red, has a strong tea culture connotation. Its popularity and business are flourishing, and Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.

It is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social economic transformation, and it also reflects the current condition of Saudi Arabia’s social and cultural development.
The exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters. Spread across six interconnected buildings, the exhibition will be presented in six units: Cross the River by Feeling the Stones, Heritage as Experiment, Thinking on a Edge, Going Public, Brave New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists take up over 40% of the total exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art. Other works from 12 Chinese artists have drawn recent attention. Some artists use recycled materials to create creative projects. For instance, Xu Bing uses waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Barclay, CEO of Dubai Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this year’s biennale will establish international dialogue, so that global audiences can have the opportunity to learn about the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and enhance interactions.
Feiyu Tian said, “The objective of the Biennale is twofold – to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogues, and to enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world.”
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

First cases of Omicron strain infection were found in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. According to reports from foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus-mutant Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported the first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain in the country on March 10.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; another infected person was a native Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contacting a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated in the hospital for treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people became negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced the first 3 cases of Myronium-derived infection in the country on June 10.
All three people were students. They returned from overseas traveling earlier this month. They were all with mild symptoms and were not admitted to hospital.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus strains, the Serbian government has continuously intensified prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 of next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by air will need to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arrival.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin administering Pfizer's novel coronavirus vaccine among the country's children aged 5 to 11.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on Thursday the country had identified three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The three cases of infection were identified by genetic sequencing of 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected by the country’s health authorities from November 9 to December 2.
A new encounter in the sky: Gemini meteor shower will appear massive on April 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy and popular science experts explained that as the last large meteor shower this year, the Geminids meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will be its biggest on December 14. Those who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night.
Beijing-based astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent objects of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not "born" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, council member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and astronomy popularization expert, said that like the New Year feature film, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can run from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Quadrantid and Perseid meteor showers, it is known as the third major meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is its relatively slow speed, rich colors and numerous fireballs, which is suitable both for visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year’s Gemini meteor shower will reach its maximum around 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors visible per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) is 150.
Chart of recommended index numbers for Geminid meteor shower.
“Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was impressive, but this year’s Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, making it less exciting.
November 14 falls on the 11th day of the lunar calendar. The moon is a crescent moon. The bright moonlight may disturb the observation. Fortunately, after the midnight, the moon will set, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will shine relatively higher.
Those who like meteor showers can observe them in these hours after the moon falls in the latter half of the night, but they should pay attention to keeping warm and cold."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended for observations in urban areas, but in the suburbs or rural areas, you can choose aplace with high altitude, low light pollution, and a bright view facing the northeast, then wait until the moon has set and then visually observe.
It should be noted that the flow of Geminid meteors in all directions is very large, so there is no need to always stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
For photographers who want to take wonderful pictures of a meteor shower, they'd better select a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, backup batteries and a cable switch are also essential.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
