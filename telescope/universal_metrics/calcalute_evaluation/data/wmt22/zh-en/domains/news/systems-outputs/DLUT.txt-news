Students singing leading roles at the Zhejiang University Academic Conference research achievements make people's brains open - Xinhua
Wash hands with air, judge diseases with tone, and search for the source of haze Precisely Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide-open brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won prizes at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Zhang Di Ming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the side of a smartphone, half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is breathe lightly. This set of instruments can initially detect your health from the gas composition you're exhaling."
Zhang Di Ming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene as a new material. Its target is the chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart operating lights: a doctor's high-energy eye
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing, a master's student in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and the team of Shin Junfei opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented smart LED surgical shadowless lights.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed at the early stage. They are related to the lamps used in doctors' surgeries."
For example, during the early detection of cancer, if the doctor can't see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread afterwards, Shin said.
This smart surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the difference of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the light spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Shaoyifu Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Children's Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub more soap, and squeeze more hand sanitizer, while students such as Li Qizhang invented a "hand wash device".
As long as we stand on the washing table of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet, and is combined with water.
That way, we can wash our hands! "
The color reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top schools and won the only gold award.
Chongqing Middle Vocational School is an enterprise's prospective employee when enrolling in a pilot modern apprenticeship system - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle-career schools. Students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After admissions, students will be prerecorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and admission procedures of middle-vocational schools and the enterprise employment procedures be standardized, and that the dual identity of the middle-vocational school students and the prospective employees of the enterprise be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way choice, the apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions, teaching contents, and protection of the rights and interests of the apprentices cultivated on the job.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out the pre-employment training and transfer training of enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
School enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the education system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the internship in the top post is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can bring 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that the students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, 60 municipal mid-career modern apprenticeship pilots were identified in three batches in our city, with each pilot number of around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting and implementing it first, and gradually implementing it from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education of school enterprises, so as to effectively improve the skills of students in posts, and improve the employment rate and employment quality of students.
Chinese Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children "high-tech" over "June 1" - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi Zhou Shan) The reporter learned from the Chinese Children's Center on the 20th that from May 28 to June 1 around the "June 1" Children's Day, the Chinese Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as the children's maker experience, the children's visual arts festival, and the parent-child book carnival, so that the children can spend the "June 1" in the charm of cutting-edge technology.

Li Zhongming, deputy director of China Children's Center, introduced at the 2016 "June 1" Children's Day media conference on the 20th that the "Loving Home Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival was the key activity of this year's "June 1" celebration at China Children's Center.
The activities focus on combining social innovation with the individual creativity of the family, experiencing various innovative education activities through the participation of children and families, making innovative practices the cultural genes of the mass family, and "doing" a new learning and lifestyle for the majority of families.
It is reported that the "Loving Home Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival includes the "Bean Fruit Maker" experience activity, the anniversary celebration of the old cattle children's exploration hall and the "Exploring the whole family's love children through June 1" activity, the VR National Experience Plan, the "Maker Tribe" interactive workshop and other dozens of cutting-edge technology experience content.
South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe the illness caused by the new omicron variant of the coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the newly treated patients they are treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but no patients have yet to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus infection.
By comparison, he said, in the last wave of the delta outbreak, the new patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. "
In the two weeks since the mutant omicron strain was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of new patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave. The average length of hospitalization has decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent new patients have died, while in South Africa's early outbreak, the proportion of deaths has reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Institute, said, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports.
He also said: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalizations while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although delta remains the dominant new strain of coronavirus in the world, omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If the famous public service advertisement is analogized with "no sale, no killing", then, in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", the collective prevention and national anti-trafficking make the abduction and trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency publishing platform for missing children developed by the Counter-Kidnapping Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and timely retrieve abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technological means not only have the name "literary and artistic" and are full of feelings, but also are properly applied, practical and effective in informatization.
The primary goal of combating abduction and law enforcement is to recover the abducted children, and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education, can enumerate a lot of "big words".
However, before the abduction case is resolved, priority should be given to the safety of the victim.
The matter is prioritized. Under the eager purpose of "rescue", such as "whether abduction and sale of children should be carried out with the death penalty" and other widely held and controversial topics can be put on hold and discussed carefully; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be discussed.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the place of commission as soon as possible after they have been successful.
When the abduction operation is delayed by one minute, the child may be further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform that directly help to solve the case and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the entire legal system.
The fight against crime and the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the rigorous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the care of "child care and support".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can also be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a railway station, and the parents slept, only to wake up and find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should be at least fairly protective.
Taking turns resting for both parents, or placing their children under safe protection, is the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party buying the abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the legal penalty for the crime of abducting and selling children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the property confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is high. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people's concepts in raising children are backward, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking, the official law enforcement cannot be relied on alone.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, the abductor is lucrative, constantly innovating the means of abduction, and forming a "fighting law" situation with the law enforcement, the fight against abduction will inevitably fall into the mire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the backward concept and popularizing common knowledge of the law will also help to eradicate the crime of abducting and selling and buying children.

Democracy summit comes to an end, and Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by the governments of 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders, came to an end on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he planned to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwanese government and a government councillor, and Luo Guanzhong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist currently living in exile in the UK, also spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said: "We know how hard the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because I've said before that, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, and it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, more resilient to the power of authoritarian cushions and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
The day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech of the day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Law Guanghong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of China's ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it to account.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use every [resource] we have to ensure that the rejuvenation of democracy is our number one priority. "
Luo also called for the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to upset General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [of the CCP] to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. '
Tang Feng, a political member of the Taiwan Executive Council, released the National Statement via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values", stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we can beat the false information without flying off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Summit for Democracy" schedule, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions in accordance with the law on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China, North Korea and other countries, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Girls are targeted as arrows to raise money for her sister: "It's OK to think of a flesh injury" - Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "human meat target, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou Girl Gan Dang 'Arrow Target' to raise money for her sister" blasted the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than an individual. The wooden board has the words "human meat target, 10 yuan, one arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda of the Xiaocheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move by soliciting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being cautioned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls "street" arrow target "fundraising is admonished
In the online image, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with "human flesh target, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it surfaced online.
Some netizens believed that the move was an "eyeball begging act", and many netizens sympathized with it.
"We found out about the situation when we patrolled to the side of the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were a lot of onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed up youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl who made the "human flesh target" has been crying, asking the passer-by to play this game; another girl helped shout at the side, saying that her friend's older sister has leukaemia, and now urgently needs the surgical fees. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of propaganda of the Xiaocheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 costs, for a moment, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, then made this behavior.
He said that in the whole process, two girls were targeted and one was responsible for laying down hands, but did not participate in it. No archery was found in the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and sent them to the microblogging site.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bow and arrows used did not fall under the scope of control.
The person in charge said that "this kind of eyeball fundraising method is not advocated."
After being cautioned by the police station's police, she had left the station.
Jixin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observatory - Professional Finance News
This year, the amount of online payment business transactions in the "Double 11" Carnival nationwide reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which hit a new high compared to previous years.
A variety of red envelopes have been reduced, and the eye-catching live broadcast with goods has once again allowed consumers to benefit. This consumption boom has, on the one hand, lamented the growing strength of national consumption, and, on the other hand, had to calmly consider the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jixin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jixin") issued rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an improvement of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, China's residents perform well at the financial consumption level, but they exhibit significant differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and they need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continued attention in financial education. The "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Young People" published by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" published by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products, and nearly half of the people are not accumulating debt. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive profligacy" label affixed by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption, and follow the trend of consumption. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risk have arisen, and
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jixin has been committed to helping the people build their happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating that consumers establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and responding positively to the call of regulation to enhance the rational consumption consciousness of consumers, especially the young.
In the past many years, Jixin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people by cooperating with top domestic institutions to launch innovation and practice contests and other forms, to help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
At the time of the twelfth twelfth, Jixin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and the correct money outlook, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and circumvent consumption and loan misunderstandings, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is important to plan ahead and make repayments on time.
If the deadline is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect future economic life such as buying a car, buying a house, etc.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it should also choose the formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Jixin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products to bring more relevant needs and diversified services to consumers, continue to help the masses improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a lifelong trusted consumer financial partner.
Vietnamese People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on them, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the requirement that they must unite in the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain of citizens of the two countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the companies of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with Iran's negotiations with the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that Gulf Arab states have condemned for not resolving the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first for the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time to propose measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate in order to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate together - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a university's long-term accumulation in the development process of a series of ideas and value pursuits, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has been shouldering a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our universities, emerging from the autumn of national distress, its spirit is deeply affected by the changes of traditional culture and times, and it advocates the value concept of "Ming and virtue, build peace" and the patriotic duty of "learning and power".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly apparent, and competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying across the world. As an important "supply side", the enterprise of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for the Integrated Advancement of the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" demonstrates the confidence and determination of China to move from a major country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become one of the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short time, accelerate the construction of several world's first-class universities and a batch of world's first-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "curve overtaking"?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, confident pathways and confident abilities, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: First, they should achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of running schools by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, and secondly, cultural advantages, inheriting the intellectual connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated in 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, in order to gather strength, shape brands and improve image; and thirdly, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthen the goal-driven, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate to catch up with the advanced level of the world.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in thousands of schools. At the same time, each school must show its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-run traditions and resource endowments.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in the running of the school: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and university enterprises, and forming a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment with cross-discipline disciplines, and actively cultivating cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of the running system and social services, carrying out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the Pan Zhejiang University industrial and academic research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and allow the university spirit to resonate with the zeitgeist.
For Zhejiang University, the "seek for innovation" school motto, the common values of "diligence, practicing morality, discerning, and honesty" and "Haina River, Enlightenment and Heavy Virtue, Open Objects and Former People, and Tree and Country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and manifests itself in the high-quality concept of drawing on the world's famous universities to run schools and educate people; the "Enlightenment of Truth" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking to good, referring to the university's pursuit of truth, and more importantly, to embrace the cultivation of virtue and the striving of personality; the "open-minded former people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, not only the pursuit of knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, but also the transformation and development of innovation; the "tree of our country" emphasizes the patriotic dedication, and
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University, which has been running schools for 120 years.
"The wise listen to the silent, the clear see the unseen".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall picture of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation and historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation excite each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus to realize the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian American groups have complained of discrimination in admissions to 3 Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three famous Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian Education Union, which led the complaint, held a news conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukon, the group's chairman, said in the release that the number of Asian applicants who qualify for admission to prestigious U.S. colleges has increased exponentially in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants in the three prestigious U.S. colleges has remained at the same level.
Many studies show that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of enrollment.
Zhao Yukon said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in the three colleges and universities, relative to the number of applicants, the admission rate of Asian people was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rates of admission for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukon told the Xinhua News Agency that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice will be able to launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian people in their admissions after finding the facts.
They also expect that the university complained of will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admissions policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Coalition was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education failed to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, the participants in the complaint also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
(German Voice) After the "Summit for Democracy" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy", which is "to draw the line of ideology, to instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and to fight against democracy in the name of false democracy, to stoke division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concept on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and staged 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy 'has long been a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to intervene in other countries.
The summit is Biden's action to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video. The leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for the problems of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
And there are also skeptical voices at the international and domestic levels in the United States. For example, the invited participants were criticized for including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some doubted that the Biden administration's real intention was to organize the summit not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
A statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is full of pathologies, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and rich and poor divisions intensifying." American democracy is a "game for the rich" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must keep it up to date in every generation. In my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "require fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long action after this Summit for Democracy, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all of us implement our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
Thinking about education: How university exams can make "academic bullies" and "academic scum" each get their own way - Xinhua
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leadership, reflecting the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the type of the exam, and let the exam truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On the university campus, students come from all over the world and have different levels of competence. In addition, the degree of study varies, and the situation of study varies greatly.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question is single-type and the repetition rate is high, and the topic is too simple, it will inevitably lead to another very different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the assault before the test. If they think of other ways, they may achieve the effect of double the effort.
In this way, there is a "school slag" that can pass and even score high without input; the "school bully" never fails in class, the homework and notes are good, and the "freak" of the exam is not much higher.
In this view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not baseless in reflecting the problems existing in the university exams, and I believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have attended universities are aware that it is not uncommon to surprise the test preparation, think of various ways to "cram" the test questions from teachers, try to draw the scope of the test, and get "key counseling" before the test. It is not surprising even to take a copy in the test, and ask the teacher for high-priced help after the test.
In the author's view, as a guide of teaching quality assessment, the measurement of a university's examination pass or not lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Enter the undergraduate level, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not to comprehensively grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination to examine.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of discipline. From the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, but it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being studied, and it is still the focus."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and does not mean that the exam questions are single and the exam questions are repeated.
In many universities, the exam will generally form a question-making group, and then the subject senior teachers will coordinate the composition of the test paper. The examination papers will also be attended by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the practicalities of teaching and learning. The topics are difficult to be normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the extent of students' learning, so that the test proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficult and the type of topic, not only to highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also to take into account the examination of competencies, and at the same time to carry out innovative design of the type of topic.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of exams exist, and students will have corresponding test preparation plans. In the long run, they will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's letter of recommendation, the Lanzhou Jiaotong University authorities attach great importance to it and have deployed the rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-inspection of course completion exams, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test paper propositions and examination links, refine the assessment of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanical solutions to the problems of single type of exam questions and repetition of topics are the topics that need to be confronted by university examinations. Of course, a corresponding system needs to be introduced. But kung fu is expensive in everyday life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is not only necessary to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation. Eating through both ends, teaching and learning will better interface, form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the reality, so that the "academic bully" and "academic scum" will each have their own place.
3,200 newborn baby unreported raw paper in Sabah due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11 October) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was running out, it had not been possible to issue the birth paper to the newborn since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people had reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairou Aminus, assured that all infants who have applied for the newspaper paper, the information has been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeiting paper will be reissued when it arrives next week.
At a news conference, he explained the 10-month-old report on the issue of printing newsprint in Sabah, an online media outlet.
He said that the relevant problems arose two months ago, and Sarawak faces the same problems.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah was different from other regions, so it was not possible to borrow stock from other states.
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
"The Bureau will send a person to Kuala Lumpur to collect the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that the additional 2 business days (December 20) will be available to the applicant."
"We will tell the applicant to go to various branches to collect the newsprint."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 newspaper raw paper so far this year.

48-hour negative nucleic acid and "buffer zone" The State Council Joint Defense and Joint Control Mechanism issued a letter demanding that the epidemic prevention and control in port cities be strengthened - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Protection and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic in port cities, requiring that those who recently left land border port cities (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) should have a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and that those who went to land border port cities should take at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notification, the time frame of the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of the determination of the port city scope by each province, region and city and the announcement, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also suggested that the port cities with conditions could study setting out epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing the zoning differentiation management policy, transforming the prevention and control spillover line into two defenses, is expected to realize the forward shift of the gate, compress the risk of the epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum results of the epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many clusters of local epidemics in China, all of which are overseas epidemics imported through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes some local epidemic surveillance and early warning not timely, closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing flow in form, cold chain items are not eliminated in place, centralized isolation sites are not standardized in management, and epidemic emergency management is not scientifically accurate.
The notification requirements, from the nine aspects of improving the epidemiological prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemiological monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of the port urban control short board weaknesses, do a good job of prevention and control without any relaxation and scientific precision, and weave and firmly the foreign defense input line.
The notice stressed that the ports and cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and the people's livelihood protection simultaneously, publish and open the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the supply of basic living goods and prices and other emerging hidden problems, and timely solve and actively respond to prominent problems of the masses.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, waterways, air ports are located, and the specific areas will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.
The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military in 20 years from the beginning of the oil pipeline video - Xinhua
(Video: Pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on the pipeline platform titled "The Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of militarism, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Unmanned aerial vehicles are used to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity, and set up homicide teams.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate the "suspects" in various ways.
A crime against humanity has stirred up hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terror" war "is more anti-terrorist and more fearful".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the United States in the name of "counter-terrorism", and poke the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhua
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the fervor of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do" before telling you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that it has crossed the "how to do" at once, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
That's why these books all share a common trait - either do the best in one go, or don't do anything at all; 100 or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" will allow anyone to admit that it is "incredibly right", but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make a determination, make a new person, and have a 180-degree transformation" path, which is precisely the Achilles' heel of many people.
For those who are unconventional, conformist and refuse to change, you must shout "you want to be converted" in his ears. It is undoubtedly a self-deception and a play on the bull.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "transformation", wrapped up, and difficult to make up their minds; or with a moment's impulse, they painted the determination of "transformation" and bravely took the first step, but often the good times are short, and they can't insist on losing the battle for a while, and it's hard to see sustainability.
The crosstalk of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow" is the classic that most conveyed this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way to potentially put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory that "small wins are big wins" - that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your door, because it's always stronger than where you are.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing.
Because the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything is adhered to.
Just follow the "next-best principle" of the road to success, its journey is only a little longer.
In short, although the "best principle" is on the surface under the banner of making everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire a few; in fact, the "next-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Liu Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) learned from the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year from the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
The bare carp of Qinghai Lake, popularly known as "Huangfu", is a unique precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of bare carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as the large number of man-made killings and the deterioration of the environment in the naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the bare carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as endangered in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes and fish farms, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for bare carp in Qinghai Lake and major rivers and tributaries in the lake region, and prohibiting the sale of bare carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake has continued to increase through measures such as artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main river channels in Qinghai Lake, and designing a scientifically reasonable "fish passage". The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that to date, the bare carp of Qinghai Lake has cumulatively implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 180 million tail, and has contributed more than 23% to the recovery of bare carp resources of Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the Three Rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued notices of no-fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and built a comprehensive no-fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The first cases of omicron infection have been detected in Mauritius and other countries - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12: Report of Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondent: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection of the new variant of the virus, Omicron.
Mauritius reported two cases of the omicron infection in the country for the first time on the 10th.
According to Maoist Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; the other infected person was a native resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Health Ministry of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of omicron infection had been confirmed in the country for the first time.
The three, all students, returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized as they were mild.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of Serbia has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive by air will have to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the new Pfizer vaccine in the country.
Malawi's Health Minister Kumbizer Chiponda said on the 9th that three cases of omicron infection had been detected in the country for the first time.

The Gemini meteor shower in the starry sky ushered in a great deal on the 14th - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Yunjian) -- As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will be extremely intense on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
Anju, an astronomer in Beijing, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the asteroid Phaeton 3200, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science popular expert, said that just like the Huan Ren blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release slot" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Along with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow and colorful, and there are not many firestorms, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely intense around 15:00 on December 14. At maximum ZHR (the number of meteors per hour you can see when the radiation point is directly above your head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index plot.
"Last year, the 'Lok Ying' Gemini meteor shower impressed people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the wonderful degree will be discounted a little.
On the 11th day of the lunar calendar, the lunar phase is convex. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, and the moon will set in the second half of the night. At this time, the radiant points of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours in the second half of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keeping warm and cold. "
How can more meteors be observed as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a high altitude, low light damage, and northeast-facing open field in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and visual observation can be made.
It is important to note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing it.
Friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous' meteor shower blockbusters', it is best to choose wide-angle, large aperture lenses, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, backup batteries and shutter lines are also essential for stability and continuity. "
Chuo Lipeng cautioned.
