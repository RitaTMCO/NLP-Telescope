The research results of students playing the leading role at the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University make people's brains open-Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with big brains were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical treatment, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this set of equipment can initially detect your health from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone, and after exhaling the air, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating lamp: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and removal of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lamps used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread later.
The intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels that enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent operating lamp has been tried out in run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! "
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing secondary vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is the prospective employees of the enterprise-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprise employment procedures be standardized, and the dual identities of secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees of apprentices be clarified. According to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific posts, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt a modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can take 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot modern apprenticeship in municipal secondary vocational schools in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot before implementation and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' post skills, and improve students' corresponding employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
With the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, and other flu-like symptoms, the Associated Press said.
Dr. UnbenPillay, director of the group, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet.
They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation, Pillay said."
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last wave of Delta had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of outbreaks; the average length of stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared with 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as saying: "at present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still early and we need to get late data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we are only two weeks into this wave of outbreaks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of COVID-19, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
Gauteng province saw a 400% increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, according to health officials, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan of "no sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction", mass prevention and control, and anti-abduction by the whole people make abduction unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and find abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technical means are not only named "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also the information technology is used properly, practically and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to find abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", controversial topics such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be subject to the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed carefully; but the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction search is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform, which directly help to solve cases and find children.
After all, "anti-abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To crack down on crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice and the meticulous law enforcement, we all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three resting at the railway station, their parents slept soundly and woke up to find that their child was gone.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the legal starting point for the crime of abducting and trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are especially serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of abducting and trafficking in children obviously belongs to the crime of heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
The legal education of these people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" of abduction exists widely, the traffickers are greedy for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, and form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcers, the anti-abduction action is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal common sense will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying children.

Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and administrative councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, spoke to the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
During a roundtable discussion on "Combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values", Tang Feng, an administrative councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a national statement by video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat false information."
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were found to have seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh injury"-Xinhuanet
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
The behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move only after collecting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "target" fundraising warned
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written in black ink. Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account number and Wechat, Alipay account number and so on.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is an "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at about 10 am on the 23 rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers at that time."
The police of Tianshui police station near the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl helped shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone was watching and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
Later, the police were identified by the public security department that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.
Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12"-Economic observation network-professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" Carnival national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
A wide variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts once again benefit consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger and stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; According to the debt Status Report of Chinese Young people released by Nielsen and the 2019-2020 China Youth consumption report released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption.86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" affixed to the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even lead to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the regulatory call to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and through cooperation with domestic top universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms of imperceptible guidance to the consumption needs of young people, help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption demand, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on economic life such as buying a car and house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more in-line and diversified services, continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a reliable consumer financial partner for consumers for life.
Vietnam People's Daily Network-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which is based on the demand that they must unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers on salvaging the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by the Gulf Arab states for not being able to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran against the background that nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running ideas and value pursuits accumulated by a university for a long time in the process of development, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is very important to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they rise in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "helping the world by virtue and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "invigorating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "the overall plan to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines" not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of backwardness, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school-running quality; Second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance image; Third, institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university on the one hand, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running a school: first, we should highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education and the combination of schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the industry-university-research cooperation system of Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, moral cultivation, discernment and truthfulness" and "Haina River, enlightenment of truth and virtue, opening things up to the people and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "talents from all over the world for my use", and absorbs the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people from world-renowned schools; "Kai Zhen Hou de" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality while pursuing truth; "opening things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also reform and development and innovation; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
The wise listen to silence, and the wise see in the invisible.
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit stir up with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment at three Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23 rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools-Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College-discriminate against Asian applicants in the enrollment process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American schools has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that research by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also expect the complained colleges and universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in enrollment at Harvard University, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the applicants also include Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani American education groups.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" held by the United States is "to draw an ideological line, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', resulting in disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting, which was held by video, was attended by leaders of 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is morbid, with money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, polarization between the rich and the poor intensifying", and American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted."We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
Educational thinking: how to make "high achiever" and "low achiever" get their own place in university exams-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college examinations have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, combined with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be a "strange status quo" that "learning dregs" can pass the level without investment, and even get high marks; "learning tyrants" never miss classes, their homework and notes are all good, and their exams are not much higher.
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam by surprise, think of various ways to "take" exam questions from teachers, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and get "key tutoring" before the exam. It is not uncommon to even carry cheat notes in the exam and ask the teacher to raise your hand after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guidance of teaching quality evaluation, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the discipline. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago, but I am still learning it, which is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will form the examination paper as a whole, and the examination marking will also be participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, in order to draw up a set of examination questions that are in line with the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty is normally distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the type of questions, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and carry out innovative design of the type of questions at the same time.
Examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination there is, students will have corresponding preparation programs, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the students' suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course closing exams, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and examination links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of examination questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination services need to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems, but kung fu is expensive in daily life, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, so that teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "high achiever" and "low achiever" can get their own way.
3, 200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11 th) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper has been used up, it has not been able to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.
However, Kailu Aminus, director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth registration paper have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained a report by an online media that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah had occurred for 10 months.
He said that the problem emerged two months ago, and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, which has delayed delivery to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah paper is different from that in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to collect birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth papers so far this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours and go to land border port cities to conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions can study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border residents of both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policies, from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local clustered epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
According to the above notice, this has exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain goods in all links, non-standard management of centralized isolation places, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The circular requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the filling of the weaknesses in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, science and precision, and weave and tighten the external defense input defense line.
The circular stressed that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the open land, waterway and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, prefectures and leagues) and the municipalities directly under the Central Government where they are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.
The truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years-Xinhuanet
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a microdocumentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black prison" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "more and more anti-terrorist".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" before telling you what you need to do.
It means that we have suddenly passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have one thing in common-either do your best in one go, or do nothing at all; it's either 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will make anyone admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "change", stagnant, and difficult to make up their minds; or with a temporary impulse, they have made a painful determination to "change" and bravely took the first step, but often the good times do not last long, and they will not be defeated for a long time, so it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes most people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, it can actually motivate a few in the end; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 7,100 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960 s and 1970 s, affected by a large number of human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continuously strengthen protection, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially multiplied and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued a ban on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and established a comprehensive ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

The Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great deal on the 14 th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast an Jiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid Phaeton 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like the New Year's blockbuster, Geminid meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that meteors are slow, colorful and have many fire meteors, which is suitable for both visual and beginners of astronomical photography.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing takes a Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, people were deeply impressed by the colorful Geminid meteor shower, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, which will be a little less exciting.
The 14th is November 11th of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a full and convex moon. Bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, when the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the last few hours after the moon, but pay attention to cold and warm protection."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light damage and a wide field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or rural areas, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to stare at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time during observation.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a gorgeous' meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, a tripod, spare battery and shutter cable are also essential."
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
