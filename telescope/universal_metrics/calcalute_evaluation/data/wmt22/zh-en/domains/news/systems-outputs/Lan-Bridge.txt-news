Students Sing the Leading Role at the Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with a long breath, and accurately searching for the source of haze. Last night, a series of insightful academic achievements were commended at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 annual academic conference.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, whose research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your Home medical Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on a smartphone, whose size was half of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and the instrument will take a preliminary check on your health from the components of the air you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling air.
Smart bands on the market can detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, which is a new material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" enables it to reflect its physical health more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating light: exquisite eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions, Switzerland.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, took a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"Early detection and removal of many diseases are not precise, which is related to the lamps used in doctors' operating rooms."
Shen Junfei said that if doctors cannot see all tumor tissues in time during early cancer examination, cancer cells will spread later.
The smart operating lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent operating lamp has been used in hospitals such as Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and others invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the sink, our weight can compress the air.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands clean!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue test prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System, and Enrollment means being an Associated Employees of Enterprises-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeships. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, the recruitment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises shall be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentice secondary vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees shall be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentice, school and enterprise shall sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices aged 16 and below 18, the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise shall sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentice on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises in the form of modern apprenticeship.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot period. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the internship will generally last for 6 months.
In practice in enterprises, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing has determined 60 pilots of the municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship system in three batches, each with about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of "pilot first, then implementation, and gradual promotion from point to area", we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training and integrated education, so as to effectively improve students' post skills and improve students' employment rate and quality.
China Children's Center is to hold a series of activities to let children enjoy the Children's Day by using "high-tech"-Xinhuanet
BEIJING, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi Zhou Shanshan) -- China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities around June 1 Children's Day from May 28 to June 1, such as Children's Maker Experience, Children's Visual Arts Festival and Parent-Child Reading Carnival, so that children can spend June 1 in the charm of cutting-edge technology, the reporter learned from China Children's Center on May 20.
It is understood that the activities held by China Children's Center during the Children's Day this year include the Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Visual Arts Festival, the "Literary Carnival" and the "Family Loves Reading" picture book series activities.
Li Zhongming, deputy director of China Children's Center, said at the 2016 Children's Day Media Briefing on June 20, "Love Home and Create Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival is the key activity of China Children's Center to celebrate the Children's Day this year.
The activity focuses on the organic combination of social innovation and family personal creativity. Through the participation of children and families in various innovative education activities, innovative practice has become the cultural gene of mass families, and "hands-on" has become a new way of study and life for families.
It is reported that the Children's Future Learning Carnival includes dozens of cutting-edge technology experience contents such as the "Douguo Maker" Experience Activity, the Anniversary Celebration of Laoniu Children's Exploration Hall and the "Explore Family Love and Children's Day", the VR National Experience Program, and the "Maker Tribe" Interactive Workshop.
Doctors in South Africa: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the coronavirus Omicron variant causes more mild, though faster, diseases than the Delta variant.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that their current treatment for COVID-19 patients had mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which were similar to flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, says he takes care of dozens of patients every day, but no one needs to be hospitalized.
Pi Lai said: "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems who would have been more vulnerable to coronavirus infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta pandemic, he treated COVID-19 patients with "dyspnea and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are going to be hospitalized in a few days."
Other doctors shared similar experiences within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusion of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half of the proportion of severe illnesses in the previous wave of outbreaks; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, compared with 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports and said: "At present, almost all signs suggest that this is a milder disease."
"It's still early, and we need later data," he added.
Hospitalizations and deaths are usually late, while we entered the wave only two weeks later."
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of SARS-CoV-2, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the pandemic.
According to health officials, new cases confirmed in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Educational Review: What should be done to save abducted children?
If the famous public service advertising slogan of "no killing without trading" is compared, in a good environment without the demand for "abduction", mass prevention and mass treatment and anti-abduction by the whole people will make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and find abducted children in time.
I heard that the app is called "reunion", and I felt warm.
The new technology is not only literary and artistic, full of feelings, but also properly applied, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can enumerate many "big words".
However, prior attention should be given to the personal safety of victims before the abduction case is resolved.
Under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics such as "whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be punished by the death penalty" with different opinions and controversies can be put on hold and discussed cautiously, but the rescue of abducted children is not allowed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to moving away from the location of the crime as soon as possible after they have committed such crime.
A minute more delay in searching for abductions, the child may be more away from parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by a point.
In this circumstance, it is indeed pragmatic to come up with an effective method such as the "reunion" platform that directly contributes to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a major task that requires the functioning of the entire legal system.
There is no need to implement the care of "nursing the young and helping the weak" in cracking down on crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice and the rigorous enforcement of law.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction can be done better, from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at a railway station, and their parents fall asleep before waking up to find their children missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but parents of young children should have at least considerable protection awareness.
Parents taking turns resting, or placing their children under safe protection, are the basic means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the side that buying abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often only a link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the property confiscated.
The crime of child abduction and sale is obviously a crime with a high penalty point and a heavy maximum sentence, under the general trend of "lightening the penalty".
But there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we must not rely solely on the strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the abductors and traffickers will be interested and constantly innovate the means of abduction, forming a situation of "fighting against law" with law enforcers, and the anti-abduction action will be inefficient.
Therefore, the elimination of backward ideas and the popularization of common legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Fire of Freedom Never Goes Out
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden of the United States and attended by leaders of governments and civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, concluded Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world and could never be extinguished by an authoritarian regime.
He also said he plans to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a Taiwanese government representative and councillor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before that, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said defending democracy required a joint effort by society as a whole.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the barriers of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to authoritarian cushions and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said."
The next day of the "Democracy Summit" was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authority, and countering digital authority and affirming democratic values.
The day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech that day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution."
Luo Guancong, a democratic human rights activist in Hong Kong, addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long embraced China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CPC.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the China market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
In attending a round-table discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan's executive councillor, Tang Feng, released a National Statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of confronting authoritarianism and authority.
He also shared his experience on how to fight COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"We have always been firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against authoritarianism and have taken a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it."
In parallel with the agenda of the second day of the Democratic Summit, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Girls use arrows as targets to raise money for their sisters: " It's okay to think of flesh wounds"-Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, RMB 10 per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl is willing to be 'target' to raise money for her sister" was posted on Moments.
A girl stands in front of a slightly higher-than-human wooden board with the words "human flesh target, RMB 10 per arrow" written on it, indicating that she can use a bow and arrow to shoot after the payment.
This behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such aggressive moves for her sister's donation, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl being a street "arrow target" for fundraising has been accused
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, RMB 10 per arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account, WeChat account and Alipay account written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image was controversial when it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is "eye-catching begging", and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We found it when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, police at the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said that there were two girls, both about 20 years old, dressed up beautifully.
Among them, the girl who is a "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl on the side shouted, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and now urgently needs surgery fees who need people's help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the reporter of the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, who raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, there is no good way to raise funds for the moment, so it did this.
He said that in the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows in the whole process, but someone watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police's identification by the security department, the use of bows and arrows does not belong to the scope of control.
"This eye-catching approach to fundraising is not advocated," the director said.
She left the police station after being warned and admonished.
Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double 12"-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News
During this year's Double 11 Carnival, the transaction amount of national online payment business reached RMB 1.77 trillion, a record high compared with previous years.
A variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live-streaming sales have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom has made people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power; on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the Double 12 Shopping Festival, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy to remind users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Survey and Analysis Report on Consumer Financial Literacy released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education; The China Youth Debt Report released by Nielsen and the China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020 released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the "excessive profligacy" label pasted by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks are generated, and even social problems gradually increase. Financial enterprises should be brave to assume social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, actively responding to the call of supervision, and taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and subtly guided the consumption needs of young people by cooperating with top domestic colleges and universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms, helping them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the Double 12 Shopping Festival, Home Credit reminded all consumers to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings about consumption and lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When consuming, be sure to plan in advance and repay on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic life such as car purchase and house purchase.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and become a consumer finance partner that consumers trust for life.
Vietnam People's Daily-GCC addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopovers include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected GCC internal solidarity and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement between the United States and Kuwait to mediate towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
Resolving differences to restore relations with Qatar in the Arab States of the Gulf stems from the need to unite in the interests of States and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit to Oman, the Saudi Crown Prince agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbors.
A 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and supply chain integration for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest USD 5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding worth USD 30 billion have been signed between the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's visit to the Gulf states coincided with talks between Iran and the world's major powers over the salvage of the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Gulf's Arab states for perceived inability to resolve their missile problems with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed to fail to address Iran's missile problem and to act to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran in the context of the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states in their nuclear talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors which slows economic growth in GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of its kind since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic outcomes that contribute to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to allow its member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
Let the University Spirit Resonate with the Spirit of the Times-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "empowering virtues to help the world and improving peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying worldwide. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also puts forward higher requirements for university development.
How to make efforts to become one of the world's most popular universities in a short period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should give full play to the three advantages: The first is the late-mover advantage. By continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and school running quality can be significantly improved.; The second is the cultural advantage, which inherits the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over the past 5,000 years and promotes the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, build brand and enhance image.; The third is institutional advantages. Give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven development, pool consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to catch up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university into a single university, and each university must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running schools: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and school-enterprise integration, and form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements.; Third, highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to continuously adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonance.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, moral cultivation, discernment and down-to-earth" and the common values of "enlightening the river, enlightening the truth and being kind, exploring the former people and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "All rivers run into sea" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "talents from all over the world are for me", and reflects the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous schools; "Enlightenment and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that while pursuing truth, universities should also accept the cultivation of virtue and the forging ahead of personality; The spirit of reform and innovation embodies the spirit of seeking innovation in knowledge and scientific research, as well as the spirit of reform, development and innovation; "Treating our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same prosperity and humiliation with the national destiny.
These spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The intelligent person hears in silence, the wise person sees in the unformed ".
Colleges and universities in China should further grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic care and freedom of independence, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

American-Asian group complains of discrimination in admissions to three famous Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhuanet
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xu Jianmei)-More than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education and Justice on May 23 against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- that discriminate against Asian applicants in the admission process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants eligible for admission to United States top schools had multiplied in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-American applicants in the three United States top schools remained basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" process.
According to Zhao Yukong, the research of Sang Desi and other scholars in 2014 shows that Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants in the three universities.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest percentage of Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected the United States Department of Education and the United States Department of Justice to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint, and to take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also hope that the complained universities will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admissions policy for Asians.
At present, the three universities under complaint have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian Education Alliance complained of discrimination in admissions to Harvard, but the United States Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese groups in the United States, there are also Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups in the United States.
(Voice of Germany, Chinese) After the Democratic Summit on Friday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday (December 11) that the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" held by the United States was "to instrumentalize, weaponize, and pseudo-democracy in the name of anti-democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and shift domestic tensions."
According to the Chinese government, "the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others for a long time, carried out 'democracy', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to intervene.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting took place by video, with 111 world leaders invited, including Taiwanese, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
At the international level and within the United States, there are voices of skepticism, such as criticizing invited leaders with authoritarian autocracy, such as those in the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who suspect that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Germany's new prime minister, Scholz, also attended the VDS
In a statement by China's Foreign Ministry on Saturday, "American-style democracy today is a pathological manifestation of the growing problems of monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic contradictions, and the division between the rich and the poor," and democracy in the United States is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
In his statement, United States President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the barriers of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to authoritarian cushions and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good."
Democracy, he stressed, is not to be taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need to be defended by fighters in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year operation after the Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions before the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Educational Thinking: How to Make "Student Hegemon" and "Student Junk" Get What They Want-Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the leaders of the university to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination and change the type of examination questions, so that the examination can truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college examinations have been a hot topic for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of abilities and different levels of learning.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination question type is single, the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the examination by concentrated assault before the examination. If you think of other methods, you may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, the "strange situation" that "school jerks" can pass or even get high scores without investing; "school hegemons" never drop out of class, have good homework and notes, and are not much higher in examinations will emerge.
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that there is not no reason for the problems in the university examination, and it is believed that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, the three students who wrote the letters were praised.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon for them to prepare for the examination, think of various ways to "take" the examination questions from teachers, strive to draw up the scope of the examination, and get "key guidance" before the examination. It is even not unusual to carry a small copy in the examination and ask teachers to be proud after the examination.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation orientation, to measure the passing or failing of a university examination lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and the scientific proposition on this basis.
In the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, basically fixed.
As some teachers say, "20 years ago, I learned the basics of college mathematics, but now I'm still learning it,which is also the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many colleges and universities, examination groups are usually formed, and then senior teachers of the subject make up the examination papers. The examination papers are also marked by all teachers responsible for the subject, so that the repeated examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the actual situation of teaching and learning. The questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time, innovatively design the question type.
Examination is the baton of university education. The different kinds of examination means that students will have corresponding examination preparation plan, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of advice from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and comparative self-inspection of course completion examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
In terms of mechanism, it is necessary to solve the problems such as single type of examination questions and repeated questions. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems. However, due to the high efficiency in daily work, teachers need to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation. If both ends are thoroughly understood, the teaching and learning will be better matched and a benign interaction will be formed, and the examination will also be more realistic, so that "students" and "students undergraduate" can get their own way.

48-hour nucleic acid test results are negative and a "buffer zone" is set up. The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhuanet
BEIJING, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring personnel leaving land border cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) recently to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours and take at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame required above is from the date when each province, autonomous region and municipality determines the scope of the port city and announces it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and the border residents of the two sides exchange frequently.
The differentiated zone management policy is implemented to change the prevention and control of spillover from one line of defense to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the barrier forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.

Don't Frighten People at the Starting Line-Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
In today's books of success, many preach the "best principle"-that is, presuming or implying that you can "do" and then telling you what you need to do.
That is to say, the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" is overrun.
For this reason, these books have a common feature-either to do the best once for all, or to do nothing at all; to be 100, or to be 0; to climb Mount Tai, or to stay where you are.
This "best principle," admitted by everyone, is "right," but 99% of people are scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, make a great 180-degree change," which is a deadly weakness for many.
For those who are obedient, old-fashioned, and refuse to change, you have to shout in his ears, "You want to change, " which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transformation" and will struggle to make up their minds; or they will be determined to "transform" on impulse and bravely take the first step, but the good times are often not long, and they will be defeated within a short time, and it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "Best Principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority of people "looking at Mönchengladbach".
Perhaps, the "sub-optimal principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "sub-optimal principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories as big victories", that is, if you can't achieve 100, you can only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because it is always better than walking in place.
Anyway, if you do something, you're better than not.
Since the threshold is greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as they persist.
The road to success, following the "second best principle", is only a bit longer.
All in all, the "best principle," despite its ostensible success for all, can ultimately motivate, in fact, a few; and the "second best principle," can effectively motivate and benefit as many people as possible.
Qinghai Lake's Gyrocarp Resources Increase by 7,100 Tons This Year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of gymnocarp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons from the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
Gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain safety and biodiversity of "water-fish-bird" in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as man-made killing and the increasingly degraded breeding water environment of gymnocarp. In 2002, the reserve of gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake Gymnocarp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Species in China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish cultivation, and prohibited any institutions, collectives and individuals from fishing Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii and selling Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii and its products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing, cleaning the main river channels into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages" and other measures to continuously strengthen protection, the reserves of Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
According to Yang Lin, deputy director-general of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, nearly 180 million Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferation and released, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan Area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued fishing ban notices in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one lake".

Starry Sky Date丨The Geminid Meteor Welcomes Great Shower on the 14th  -Xinhuanet
TIANJIN, Dec. 12 (Xinhua/Zhou Runjian)-As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely great on December 14. People who like meteor showers can observe it at midnight.
Gemini meteor shower shot by Beijing astronomer An Jiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor shower's parent bodies are periodic comets, but the Gemini shower's parent body is the  asteroid (3200) Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, a council member of the Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert in astronomy science popularization, said that, just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. It is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and Perseid meteor shower.
A remarkable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroids, the rich colors,and the number of fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
Gemini meteor shower shot by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will take place around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).

"Last year, the 'colorful' Gemini meteor shower impressed people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the level of excitement will be reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the phase of the moon is the surplus-convex moon, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the second half of the night, but pay attention to keep warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. Instead, you can choose a place with high altitude, small light damage and wide vision facing northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon falls and observe visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower in all directions is large, so there is no need to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower during observation.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower', you'd better choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens with a high ISO and maximum aperture.
For stability and continuity, tripods, backup batteries and shutter wires are also essential."
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
