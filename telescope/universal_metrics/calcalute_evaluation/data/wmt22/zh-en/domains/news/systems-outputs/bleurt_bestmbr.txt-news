Students take a lead role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, research results make people’s minds open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wash your hands with air, judge the disease with a breath, and accurately search for the source of the haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of thought-provoking academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research has covered various fields including the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and so on. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at domestic and international level.
Biosensors: Your home health checker
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, and his team demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone and that after exhaling air, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new type of material, which targets chemical elements, and its keen “smell” enables it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart Surgery Lights: The Doctor's High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and incomplete removal of many diseases are related to the lights that doctors use in operating rooms."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer examination, if doctors fail to identify all tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light disks that can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-less rate at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by using water and at the most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have created an “air hand washing device”.
Once we stand on the provided sink, the air will be compressed by our body weight.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
} This way, we can wash our hands clean!”
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption at all, and is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Chongqing vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admitting employees for prospective enterprises - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the training will have apprenticeship status. After they are enrolled, the pilot enterprises will pre-record them as employees of their units.
The Municipal Education Commission has called for standardizing the recruitment, admissions and employer employment procedure of secondary vocational schools, clarifying the dual identities of the students in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises. According to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentices, schools and enterprise must sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who reach the age of 16 but not 18, there are four parties which must sign an agreement, such as apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises, to define the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, rights and interests guaranteed for the on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship system to carry out pre-job training and job-transfer training for employees in cooperation with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent training models.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans and formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training schooling system as a pilot period. The internship time of students in the company is determined according to the professional personnel training program and the post-internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, a team-based management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has decided to establish 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches. Each pilot program is about 50 people, training a total of about 3000 students (apprentices).
Following the principle of first piloting and then implementing and gradually advancing from point to area, we will explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and companies so as to effectively improve students’ job skills and increase their counterparts’ employment rate and employment quality.
China Children's Center to hold a series of activities to let children get through "Six Day" in a "high-tech" way - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi, Zhou Shanshan) The reporter learned from the China Children's Center on the 20th that from May 28 to June 1, around the "June 1" Children's Day, the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities such as the children's maker experience, children's visual art festival, and parent-child reading carnival, so that children can spend the "June 1" in the charm of cutting-edge technology.

South African doctor: Omicron’s transmission capability is strong, but most cases are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omicron variant causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to a report from the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the coronavirus patients they were currently treating were experiencing milder symptoms, such as body aches and coughs, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none has yet required hospitalization.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more likely to become severely ill due to the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, he said, during the last Delta outbreak, patients he treated with COVID-19 “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.”
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.”
In the two weeks following the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other physicians shared similar experiences.
While it may take several weeks for enough data to be collected, doctors' observations and early evidence offer some clues.
According to the report from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the novel coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks had severe symptoms, which is half the seriousness rate in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in earlier outbreaks in South Africa is as high as 20%.
"At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: “It’s still early days and we need to get the late stage data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus globally, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Education Review: What can we do to save the abducted children?
If it is analogous to the famous PSA slogan “No trade, no killing”, then in a favorable environment without the demand of “abducting”, group prevention and control, and anti-trafficking by all people make abductions unprofitable, risky, and expensive and hence, crimes like these won't happen again and again.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard the name of this app called Reunion, I felt a warm feeling.
The new technology not only has a name “literary and artistic” and is full of feelings, but also employs appropriate information technology, and is practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to recover the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The next step is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated in numerous “big words.”
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
The first priority is to focus on the urgent "rescue" purpose, so the many controversial topics, such as "whether child abductees should be punished by death", can be put off for a while and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot be waited.
Based on the experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to leave the crime site as soon as possible after successful investigation.
Delaying the kidnapping operation for one more minute will probably lead to the child being farther away from the parents and the difficulty of investigating the case will increase by a point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective approaches like the “Reunion” platform that will directly help detect cases and retrieve children.
After all, combating kidnapping is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
In combating crimes and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the improvement of legislation to judicial guarantees to careful law enforcement, it is essential to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak."
In addition, child trafficking prevention, both within families and in society, can be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rested at the train station. Parents were asleep and woke up only to realize that the child was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protective skills, but as a parent of a younger child one should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns between parents or placing children under secure protection are minimal steps for preventing child abductions.
From the other side of the police's fight against abduction and child trafficking, the party buying abducted children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China’s “Criminal Law”, the statutory penalty for abducting and trafficking children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the sentence can lead to death and confiscation of property.
The penalization point is high and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, many cases of human trafficking still occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts on raising children and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this segment of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict legal enforcement by officials.
If the “market” for abduction and trafficking is widespread, traders become obsessed with self-interest, constantly innovate means of trafficking, creating a “fighting” situation with law enforcement officers, and anti-trafficking operations will inevitably fall into an inefficient mess.
Therefore, breaking the backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eliminate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.

The Democratic Summit ends and Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold a second global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how daunting the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before and as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish the little fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people around the world and everywhere."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint effort of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent, accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” were defending human rights, solidifying democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking at the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of their continued concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China’s ethnic minorities including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has accepted China's rise without having a mechanism in place to hold it accountable," he said.
That’s why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use whatever [resources] we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against CCP threats.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t recognise the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is why we have to change.”
During the roundtable discussion on combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values, Tang Feng, member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line of countering dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences on how to fight against the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As democracy in Taiwan is on the rise, we remain firmly in the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of backsliding, with authoritarian governments everywhere rationalizing human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without having to close down the city, and we can defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
While the second day of the Democracy Summit was in progress, the US Treasury Department announced to impose sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries including China and North Korea that were identified as having severe violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment constraints on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.

Girl becomes an arrow target and raises funds for her sister: "It's okay if it's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of "Hangzhou girl willing to become an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" has made it viral in the circle of friends.
The photos show a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a big wooden board that is slightly taller than a human being. The words "human flesh target, ten yuan for one arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity leader of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such drastic move in raising funds for her sister, but such behavior was not worthy of advocacy. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl is told to raise donations from street "arrow targets"
In the images posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large board with the character of "G" on it. The words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow are written in black ink." Another board in front of her has her bank account number, WeChat ID, Alipay account number etc. written on it.
The picture sparked controversy after it appeared online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "begging behavior to attract attention", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
The police in the Tianshui police station near the incident site told local media that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful looks.
Among them, the girl who is "human flesh target" kept crying, begging passers by to play the game. Another girl was shouting beside her, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now desperately needs surgery fees. Please help.
"We contacted local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity from the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 dollars, we made this action because we couldn't think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the entire process, one of the two girls acted as the target, the other was in charge of the shoot, but they were not involved. During the whole process, no one was found shooting arrows. Some people were just watching and taking a photo and posting it on Weibo.
After identification by the public security department, police determined that the bow and arrows used were not subject to control.
The person in charge said that "this way of soliciting eyeball donations is not recommended".
After being warned by police station residents, she has left the police station.
Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on Eve of “Double Twelve” - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year’s “Double Eleven” Carnival’s national online payment transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of resale red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people feel that the spending power of the people is getting stronger, but on the other hand, they have to calm down and consider the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Generally speaking, Chinese residents perform better in financial consumption, but there are large differences in different aspects of financial behaviors and skills, thus requiring additional improvements in basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, “one old and one young” will remain the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "Report on Debt Situation of Chinese youths" and "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" issued by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish good and correct consumption attitudes, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance consumers, especially young people, rational consumption awareness.
Over the past years, Home Credit has been conducting comprehensive and diversified financial literacy popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperating with top domestic universities to launch innovation practice competitions and other forms, we have subtly guided the young groups' consumption needs in various ways. It helps them establish rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumption requirements, thus helping them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends of cultivating reasonable consumption awareness and correct perspective on money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misunderstanding in consumer lending, so as to avoid affecting personal credit evaluation and future economic life.
Be sure to plan ahead when spending, and make repayments on time and within your means.
If we exceed the due date, the overdue record will be recorded on our personal credit report, which may adversely affect your economic life such as purchasing a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to leverage on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and the constantly updated and iterative financial products to provide consumers with better-fitting and diversified services, constantly assist the public in improving their financial literacy, help consumers develop ideas of rational consumption and moderate lending, and serve as consumers' lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partners.
NDO – Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed’s first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist organisations and having close ties to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously undermined the internal unity of the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait toward "solidarity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopens its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of their differences to restore relations with Qatar arises out of a demand for mutual unity dependent upon national interests and regional stability, aiming to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate travel for citizens of both countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memoranda of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince’s visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — a deal that Gulf Arab states have denounced as not being able to resolve their missile issues with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activity in the region is flawed.
In a time when nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran have failed to satisfy the wishes of various Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia is conducting direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity and to propose measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
Let the spirit of the university resonate at the same frequency with the spirit of the times - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed over a long period of time during a university's development journey, and is the soul of a university.
From ancient times until today, university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the world’s first university in the modern sense was born, the university has shouldered unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged in the midst of national crisis, whose spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of times, advocating the value of “moral virtue, helping the world, and maintaining peace” and the role of patriotism of “relaunching education and strengthening the country”.
Currently, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education has become increasingly evident. Competition in education, technology, and talents across the globe is becoming ever more intensified. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines” demonstrates China’s confidence and determination to advance from a major country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, and also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to endeavor to become one of the world's top ranks within a relatively short period of time and speed up the building of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, while still having a certain gap, and to achieve "overtaking on the curve"?
In addition to asserting our self-confidence in goals, paths and ability, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: first, our latecomer advantage. We will continue to introduce outstanding academic talents from overseas, and learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to realize a significant improvement in the academic level and quality of education. Second, we will inherit the wisdom accumulated by the Chinese civilization over five thousand years to promote the development of outstanding traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and improve our image. The third is institutional advantages. We use the institutional superiority of a socialist nation to strengthen target-driven, synergistic efforts to optimize resource allocation and provide a sustainable and sustainable way for schools to catch up with the international advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to be aware that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools. Each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while leveraging its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, school running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we emphasize three characteristics in running a school: first, to highlight the innovative and entrepreneurial talent development characteristics, building a comprehensive educational environment incorporating the integration of science and education and school-enterprise fusion, and to form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, to highlight the characteristics of intersecting and converging disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate intersecting emerging disciplines and iconic crossover achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of university running system and social services, and establishing in-depth exchanges and cooperation between industries, universities, and research institutes, accelerating the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "studying emphatically, cultivating morality, discerning intelligence, and being sincere" and "Hinaden Rivers, instil true and great virtues, open things up for the people and foster a nation and state," together constitute the latest system to express the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, accumulate cultural heights and consolidate spiritual strengths. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mindset of "a world-renowned talent for me use" and reflects the idea of garnering high quality education of people out of school; "Initiative and Honesty" stress the spirit of seeking truth and perfection; the university should understand the cultivation of morality and the tempering of its personality while pursuing truth; "Innovation and pioneering" reflects a spirit of reform and innovation: it includes seeking for knowledge and innovation and research should also be expressed as the reformation and development of the country.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
"Those who are intelligent hear the silence; those who are clear see the invisible".
Chinese institutes of higher education should further base themselves on the overall context of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand higher education’s current orientation and historical mission, and accelerate its progress toward building itself into world-leading universities.
At the same time, adhere to the humanistic concern and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for realizing national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and three Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College — discriminated against Asian applicants during their admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, the group's chairman, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious US universities has doubled, but in these three elite American schools, the Asians' percentage has remained basically the same.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges “persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “universal” admissions processes.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth have the lowest admit rates for Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas on Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after filing a complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice would launch an investigation, and take steps after the fact was determined, to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect that the colleges receiving complaints will take the initiative to take this issue into consideration and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities subject to complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance, founded in 2015, filed a complaint against Harvard College for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, those involved in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Saturday (December 11) that the United States was holding the "Leaders' Democratic Summit" to "draw lines with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and under the pretext of dissimulating democracy, it goes against the truth of democracy, incites splits and confrontation, and diverts domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the US to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden’s move to fulfil his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video and invited leaders of 111 countries around the world, including leaders from Taiwan. China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was unqualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States. For example, people who were invited to attend the summit include some leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some doubt that the real intention of the Biden administration is not to organize this summit for democracy but geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German chancellor Scholz also attends the video democracy summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry’s statement on Saturday stated that “the sickness of American-style democracy is fully manifested today, as the problems of money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and divisions between rich and poor are becoming increasingly severe.” American democracy is a”rich man’s game” built on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not something to take for granted: "We have to renew it throughout every generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our times."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "confront persistent and worrying challenges; democracy requires warriors to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the Democracy Summit with a year-long campaign that will include a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit scheduled for late 2022.
"Let all of our nations follow through on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Educational thinking: How to make the "student masters" and "educational scumbags" have their own proper places in college examinations - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leadership reflecting their confusion about the university exam and proposed improving the difficulty of the exam and changing the types of exam questions so that the exam can truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a “hot topic”.
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying ability levels and, combined with their different levels of learning, learning situations vary vastly.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the test through a concentrated attack before the exam. If they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a “strange situation” where “students” usually pass the test without putting in effort, and even get high grades; they never drop classes, their homework and notes are extremely good and exams are not much better.
From this point of view, students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University report that the problems in university examinations are not without reason. We believe that this situation does not only exist at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I want to pay praise to these three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, everyone who has attended college knows well that it is not uncommon for people to make surprise preparations for exams, try to use all kinds of methods to “take” exam questions from teachers, try to classify the scope of exams, and get “key tutoring” before exams. It is not unusual for them to include cheat sheets during examinations, and to ask teachers to show their respect after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guide for evaluation of teaching quality, measuring the success of a university examination depends on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning as well as the scientific propositions based on them.
As students enter the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided and many major courses focus on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether or not you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is something to be examined in university exams.
Undergraduate knowledge essentially consists of basic theories and common sense of the subject. From a knowledge point of view, there is little room for change and is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, “Twenty years ago, we learned the basic knowledge of university mathematics, but we still learn it today and that remains the focus.”
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, examinations usually consist of question groups, which are then organized by senior teachers of the subject to form examination papers. Exam grading is also completed by all teachers responsible for the subject. This way, to a certain extent, the duplication of test questions can be overcome.
However, we need to draft a set of test questions, which are consistent with the actual circumstances of teaching and learning. The degrees of difficulty are normally distributed based on the overall condition of student learning. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze students' learning levels, thus making the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type. It can not only highlight the basic knowledge inspection, but also consider the ability test, and at the same time innovatively design the question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. Whatever kind of exam there is, students will have corresponding preparation plans. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestion letter from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination on end-of-course examinations, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of test paper propositions and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen overall assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems like single type of test question and repeated topics are issues that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding system should be introduced, but the efforts are costlier in daily life, and teachers need to have comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the student's learning situation. If you understand both ends, teaching and studying will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the examination will variety more according to the reality, so that "student masters" and "learning scumbags" each have their own right.
3,200 of Sabah newborn babies had no birth certificates as special anti-counterfeit paper was out of stock
KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah National Registration Office stated that due to the lack of stock of specially-made anti-counterfeiting papers, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, with a total of 3,200 people affected so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerou Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their details recorded in the system, and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a report by an online media that there was a 10-month-long problem with newspaper printing in Sabah.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in shipping to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah’s birth certificates is different from that in other regions, and therefore it is impossible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
“The bureau will send people to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and then go back to Sabah to complete the final printing. It is estimated that it will be delivered to applicants in 2 more working days (December 20).”
"We will inform applicants to go to local branch offices to obtain the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

Practice has once again proved that the Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's central leadership and core status of the entire Party and the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is of decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country in the new era and for enhancing the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the center of the Party Central Committee and the core leader of the entire Party at the helm, with the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and the unity and perseverance of the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups, we will be able to overcome various difficulties and obstacles, create new era glories, and forge new historical achievements on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way.
Next year the Party's 20th National Congress will be held, which is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country.
Carrying forward the great party building spirit, adhering to the general key of the work of making progress while maintaining stability, completely, accurately, and fully implementing new development concepts, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, holding on to innovation-driven development, promoting high-quality development, adhering to supply-side structural reform as the main line, coordinating the epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, overall development and security, continuing to do a good job in "six stability" and "six guarantees", and continue to improve people's livelihood. We will maintain a stable macroeconomic market, keep the economy running in a normal range and maintain a positive social overall situation. We will be able to maintain a stable and healthy political environment and a clean and healthy economic environment for the party and the people.
Let us unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, strengthen the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen the "Four Self-confidences", achieve the "Two Maintenances", and continuously enhance the ability of political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, take practical actions to implement the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements and continuously push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

According to an official from the National Health Commission’s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar for the local area, with frequent exchanges between border residents from both sides.
Implementing a differentiated management policy across regions, shifting from one defense line for spill prevention and control to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of outbreak spillover, and achieve the greatest impact on epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimal social cost.
Recently, multiple local clusters of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this has exposed issues such as inadequate monitoring and early warning of epidemic in some localities, lack of implementation of closed-loop management of people in high-risk posts, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items, incorrect management of centralized isolation places, and inaccurate scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to focus on nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, speed up to make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses of prevention and control in port cities, do a good job of prevention and control without easing, scientifically and accurately, and tighten the strong lines of defense against foreign imports.
The notice emphasized that each port city should simultaneously research and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work and people's livelihood security work, publicize and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to outstanding issues reflected by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities mentioned include the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (districts, prefectures, alliances) and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.
YouTube video shows the truth about the U.S. military's bloodthirsty killings over the past 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source:Youtube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled “Killing Machine” on YouTube attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States starting the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing 20 years of military violence, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents, and various crimes against humanity.
They use drones in raids on civilian places such as hospitals, schools, etc., distorting human nature, and creating murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has murdered tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have stirred more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war “will cause more terror”.
The war did not bring the hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people but only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let us unveil the truth about bloodthirsty killings in the US in the name of “anti-terrorism” and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful study books.
Many of today's success books promote “best practices” – first assuming or implying that you can “do it” and then tell you the “what” of what needs to be done.
It amounts to saying that we have skipped over "how to do it?" the most important and fundamental part.
Precisely for this reason, these books have one thing in common – either do it as best as you can or do nothing at all, either a 100 or a 0; you either climb Mount Tai or you simply stay put.
This "best principle" can be admitted to "extremely correct" by anyone who looks at it, but 99% of the people will be frightened at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you must make up your mind, become a new person, and make a 180-degree transition”, which happens to be the fatal weakness of many people.
To someone who sticks to the rules, follows convention and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear. This is undoubtedly a deceitful act of deceiving oneself and others.
Most people would be timid in front of the word “change”, hold back and they have a difficulty in making up their minds. Or they will use a sudden impulse to make the decision to “change”, and take the first step courageously. But it is usually a short-lived situation. After a while, they fail, and it is hard to see continuity.
Mr Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that expresses this "universal human nature" most vividly.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limitations of ordinary people’s ability, making most people "sigh with awe."
Perhaps the “second-best principle” is an approach that may put more ordinary people on a path to relative success.
The core of “The Next Best Principle” is to “lower the threshold” - what it encourages is a kind of “small wins makes for big wins” theory, that is, if you cannot do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you don’t get to Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more chances for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one persists in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It’s just that the road to success following the 'second best principle’ is a bit longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of enabling all the people to succeed, ultimately it can actually inspire only a few, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increases by 7,100 tonnes this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year to 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection period in 2002, the cumulative increase was more than 40 times.
The common name of Qinghai Lake naked carp is "Huangyu", which is a unique and precious species of fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the security of the "water - fish - bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-made mass killings and the increasingly degraded aquatic environments for breeding naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the “Red List of China’s Species”.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp on Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers leading to Qinghai Lake water, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection effort has been continuously strengthened, and the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially proliferated and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the recovery of the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource exceeds 23 percent.
The Three River Source region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area controlling the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three River Headwaters and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain biodiversity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has recently issued announcements of ban on fishing in key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has set up a comprehensive management system of “one river, one river and one lake”.

Tea sector in the province is stepping up innovation and the main tea types like green tea, dark tea and black tea are taking turns to develop, and the main tea production areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, which will drive the majority of tea farmers to increase their incomes.
Fengshui is changed and black tea becomes powerful again.
Experts from the tea industry across the province said that after picking green tea and collecting black tea and dark tea, tea farmers are earning income all year round and the tea garden output value has soared.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders granted licenses to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua joyfully promoted "The Source of Lake Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called “Bing Lichun” and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that factors such as the current epidemic are affecting the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but judging from the tea expo scene, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea has a red touch, infused with tea culture connotation, which is highly popular and hot in trade. The Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.

Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total exhibition quantity, covering various types such as paintings, installation art and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attract much attention. Some artists use recycled materials in creative ways, such as Xu Bing's "Back Story Series - Endless Scene of Streams and Mountains" (2014), which used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
John Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale will establish an international dialogue and provide global audiences with an opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and to strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said: "The aim of the biennale is twofold: to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.
Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Dec. 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment support for those out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies for promoting rural revitalization and rural public welfare jobs management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to place the poverty-stricken laborers and other poor groups in rural areas for employment.

First cases of Omicron strain infection were discovered in Mauritius and other countries - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Comprehensive reports from foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection by a new coronavirus variant Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist arriving in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27. The other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. After coming into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned, his nucleic acid test tested positive on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected patients turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus’ Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three of them were students and came back from a trip abroad earlier this month. Because they all had mild symptoms, they were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus strains, the Serbia government has continuously enhanced prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and older who enter the country by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer’s new crown vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The country’s health authorities conducted genome sequencing of 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three cases of infection.
Starry sky is coming and the Gemini meteor shower will be huge on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12. (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a huge event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not formed by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on popular science in astronomy, said that just like New Year blockbuster films, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year and the "release period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability and is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the fact that meteors are at a slower velocity, with rich colors and a lot of fireballs, which are suitable both for visual viewing and for beginners to shoot astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year’s Geminid meteor shower will experience its maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal viewing conditions, the number of meteors can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above head) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommendation index chart.
“Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was impressive, but this year’s Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, making it less exciting.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the lunar calendar, and the moon's phase is the gibbous moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can make observations in the late hours of the night after the moon falls, but pay attention to protecting against the cold and keeping warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to conduct observations in cities. You can choose a location in the suburbs or countryside with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast, and then patiently wait until the moon sets before you can visually observe.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and you don’t need to constantly stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If anyone who loves photography wants to shoot a magnificent ‘meteor shower’, it is best to choose a wide-angle, wide-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, a spare battery and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
