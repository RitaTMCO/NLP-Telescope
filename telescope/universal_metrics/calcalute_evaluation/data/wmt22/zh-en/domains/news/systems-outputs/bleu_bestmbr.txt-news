Undergraduate students at Zhejiang University annual meeting, research results are inspiring - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wash hands with air, judge diseases with breath, accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-filled academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, whose research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and excision of many diseases are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer examination, if doctors cannot see all tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented an "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the device's sink, and our body weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.
Chongqing secondary vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admission is industry prospective employees - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who received training will have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as team employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and admissions procedures of vocational schools and the employment procedures of enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices are also identified as secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of the enterprise. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, the apprentice, the school and the enterprise sign a tripartite agreement, and the apprentice, guardian, schools and enterprises must sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of each party, the specific positions, teaching content and rights protection of apprentices in these situations.
Encourage pilot schools to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for employees in the form of modern apprenticeships and cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 pilots of municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship in three batches, each with about 50 students and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
According to the principle of piloting and then implementing itotically, from point to face, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve the skills of students to position, and improve their counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission, but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Ormicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have required hospitalization.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, in the last wave of Delta, he said, the patients he treated with Covid-19 had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctor observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa:of the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% were severely ill, which is half of the severe disease ratio in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent patients died, and in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Education Review: What to rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no killing," then in a favorable environment where there is no demand of "abducting abduction", mass prevention and control and all people fighting against abduction make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and cost high, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to retrieve abducted children in time.
I heard that the app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technology means is not only named "literary" and full of feelings, but also can be used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of trafficking and law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, before the abduction case is solved, the personal safety of the victim should be given priority.
The priority of the matter, under the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether abducted children should be sentenced to death" and other widely controversial裱 can be put on hold, and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed by one more minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that can directly help to detect cases and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to judicial protection, and meticulous law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "nursing and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at the train station, the parents are sound-sleeping, only to wake up to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a fair amount of protection.
Taking turns resting between parents, or keeping children under secure protection, is the least of the tactics to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police’s crackdown on abduction and trafficking, the party purchasing abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may be the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The penalization point is high and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official and strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction exists widely, and the traffickers are full of greed, constantly innovating methods of abduction and forming a "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the addiction campaign will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking out of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.

The Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
The Taiwan government representative and political councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
A tyrannical regime can never extinguish the little fire of liberty that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and push for reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance, more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to run naked in pursuit of power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including using all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of their ongoing concern over the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We have to use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
During a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Primitive Democratism and affirming democratic values", Tang Feng, a political committee member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "State Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As democracy in Taiwan is in the ascendant, we always stand firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and take a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of going backwards as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
During the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were藜estly violated human rights. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival national online payment business transaction volume reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety reduced red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger, but on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and on contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform better in financial consumption, but they are different in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education. As found in the "Report on the Debt of Young Chinese People" issued by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation overall presents a rational consumption trend. Although the outward label, even claimed to cause excess social problems and responsibility by companies, leads them with financial pressure and financial over-UK banking behaviors.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, actively responding to the call from regulators, and taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the young group.
In the past years, Home Credit has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and has cooperated with the top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to rationally guide their consumption needs, helping them establish rational consumption concepts and a reasonable plan for consumption needs, so as to help them accumulate wealth in life.
When Double Twelve is coming, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer misunderstandings, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When spending, you must plan ahead and repay on time within your means.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car orDimension in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to provide consumers with more suitable and diversified services, enabling the public to improve financial knowledge, help consumers develop the concepts of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a lifelong reliable consumer finance partner for consumers.
NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council to tackle common challenges
stops for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Amid the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively affecting the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states bridging their differences to restore relations with Qatar stem from a demand for unity for the interests of the countries and regional stability, aimed at meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as impossible resolve their missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Various Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
In the background that nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failed to meet the wishes of various Gulf states, Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of the GCC countries since the dispute between some members with Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, presenting measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
Let the spirit of university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by long-term accumulation of a university in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, rising in the autumn of national crisis, the spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of times. It advocates the value concept of "bright morality and socialism, builds peace by strengthening both" and patriotism of "prospering study and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The global competition of education, technology and talents continues to intensify. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “The Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Top Disciplines” not only demonstrates our confidence and determination to move forward from a big country of higher education to a solid country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How to efforts to rank among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap to achieve "overtaking on the bend"?
Besides resolute confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: first, late-development advantages, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from advanced experiences of world-class universities, to radically improve their academic level and quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom connotation accumulated by the Chinese civilization for five thousand years, carry forward and develop excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and enhance image; third, system advantages, leverage the institutional superiority of a solid socialist country, strengthen target drive, pool consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation, and provide sustainable means for schools to catch up with the leading international level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university like all schools. While giving full play to their advantages, each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on three outstanding features in running a school: firstly, accentuate the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, build an integrated education environment integrated with the integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, to create a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively foster interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-products; third, highlight the characteristics of university running systems and social services, and carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovating", the common values of "diligence, morality, discernment, and sincerity" and "letting the rivers and rivers, inspiring true virtues, pioneering people, and building our country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mindset to "use all the talents in the world for me", and expresses itself as the acquisition of the high-quality concept of running and educating students at world-famous schools ; "Reason and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should accept the cultivation of virtue and temperament along with the pursuit of truth; "削仁之心" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the spirit of seeking new knowledge and scientific research, and emphasizing that it should be reform and development and the commonwealth of the future with justice.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silent, and the wise see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to the humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit, the spirit of the times and the national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Asian American group sues Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discriminate against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet admission requirements for top American schools has doubled. But in these three prestigious American schools, the proportion of Asian Americans has remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in their so-called "general-based" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, a study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentages of Asian-American applicants among all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after filing the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions after finding the facts.
They also hope that the complainants' universities will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the parties involved in the complaint include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
(DW Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders Democracy Summit" to "draw lines by ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and deceive its reality in the name of democracy, instigate division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the US to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both in the world and in the United States. For example, some leaders who were invited to the conference include some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
The Chinese foreign ministry statement on Saturday said that "Today's American-style democracy became ill with its intensified problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the division between the rich and the poor." American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, "We have to constantly renew it in each generation, which in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs champions to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Educational thinking: How to make "efighters" and "scumbags" get their own way - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the type of exam questions, so that the exam truly reflects the students’ actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, combined with different levels of learning, with enormously different learning situations.
Assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hardCOS may pass the test. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "students" can pass the test without any input or even get high marks; "students" usually never miss classes, their assignments and notes are good, and their exams are not much higher than that of the "excellent status".
It seems that the students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the university examinations are not without cause, I believe this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote directly.
In fact, everyone who has been to college knows that it is not uncommon to preempt共享 tests, seek various ways to "trick" test questions from teachers, try to delineate the scope of the test, and get "key tutoring" before the test. It is not uncommon to even carry cheat sheets and ask teachers to prove their valuable hand after the test.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, the qualification of a university examination depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense. From a knowledge point of view, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learnt, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally into question sets, then senior teachers in the discipline make up the examination paper, and the examination papers are also attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so that the duplication of examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of examination questions that conform to the facts of teaching and learning. The questions are based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of student learning so that the examination propositions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type. It can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, innovatively designed the question type.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams are required, students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of advice from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and post-course examination comparisons on self-checks, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the performance assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of examination questions and repeated questions is a problem that the university examination affairs need to face. Of course, there needs to be a corresponding system. However, it is󠄡ṣday troubles and required teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation, both ends, teaching and learning will be more well connected, forming a positive interaction, and testing will also be more realistic, so that "cyclical masters" and "原始梦 Quins" will each have their own shares.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificate because the special anti-counterfeiting paper is out of stock
KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the exhausted inventory of specially-made anti-counterfeiting papers, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to new born babies since the beginning of October, which has affected 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairou Aminus, assured that all the babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and that they will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At a press conference, he explained to an online media report that the issue of printing newspapers in Sabah had been running for 10 months.
He said the issue arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to China."
He explained that the security paper used in Sabah birth paper is different from other regions, so it cannot borrow stocks from other states .
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
"The bureau will send someone to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final phase of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will notify applicants to go to local branches to collect the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

Recently, there have been many local clustered outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notification pointed out that this has exposed the problems of untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, unimplemented closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, insufficient killing and sterilization of cold chain items, non-standardised management of centralized isolation sites, and lack of scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be made in nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the improvement of the weak points of port cities' prevention and control, and to do a scientific and accurate prevention and control work without relaxation and strengthen the anti-import defense line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronously research and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work with livelihood security work, publish and open the livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly address and actively respond to the prominent problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (regions, states, alliances) and the municipalities where they are located. The specific limits are determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and make announcements in a timely manner.
YouTube video shows the truth about U.S. bloodthirsty killings in 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on YouTube attracted widespread attention.

A series of crimes against humanity fuels more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terrorism" war is "more counter-terrorism," .
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Most success books today preach "best principles"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It is like saying that the "how to do it" is actually the most important and fundamental link.
As such, all of these books have one thing in common – either do your best at it or do nothing at all; either 100 or 0; either you go to Mount Tai, or you just stay put.
This "best principle" will admit that it is "very true", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start over, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to convention, conform to the old, and refuse to change, you have to yell "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will show their fear in front of the word "change", hold back and struggle to make up their minds; or on impulse, they will make a decision to "change" and take the first step bravely, but often things don't last long, they lose a competitive advantage if they persist for a while. It is hard to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting From Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, and makes most people "stunned."
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that might put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - which encourages a kind of "small wins for the big wins" theory, that is, if you can't achieved 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is supposed to make everyone succeed on the surface, it actually motivates a small number of people in the end; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
The reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year, reaching 108,500 tons, an accumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to a large number of human-made hunting and the degenerate environment of naked carp breeding water, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a stagnant lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning of the main rivers and rivers of Qinghai Lake, and scientific and reasonable design of "fish passages", continuous efforts in protection are continued. The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million barley carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers source region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the eastward spreading of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Headwaters and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued prohibitions on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and constructed a comprehensive management system for a management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

Starry sky promises 丨 Gemini meteor shower ushered in a great on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a perfect date on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science expert, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, rich in color, and there are a lot of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) invoiced for 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Beautiful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the highlights will be reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the lunar month. The moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the late hours of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keep warm and cold.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon has set before you can see it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so you do not need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower consistently.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a brilliant “meteor shower blockbuster”, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
