Research results of students singing leading roles at the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University open the human brain - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with breath, and accurately searching for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with large brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other fields, students from a curious idea to create a lot of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smartphone side, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is breathe a little, and the instrument can initially detect your health from the composition of the gas you exhale."
According to Zhang, the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands on the market that can detect health generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses a new material, graphene, which targets chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of health.
Smart operating lamp: high-energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of the traditional operating lamp, and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadow-less lamp.
"A lot of diseases early detection, resection is not in place, with doctors operating room lights."
For example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, the cancer cells will spread later, Shen said.
The intelligent operating lamp has four discs that adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues in light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-free rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent operating lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students have invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed hand sanitizer, our weight compresses the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and binds to the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, not only to ensure the degree of washing, but also to save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes a milder disease than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughing, similar to flu, AP reported.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have yet to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." Pillay said
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into severe illness from coronavirus infection.
By contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days".
In the two weeks after the omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to South Africa's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are severe, half the severity of the previous wave; the average length of stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease."
He added, "It's still early, and we need late data.
Normally, hospitalisations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospital admissions, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the world's leading COVID-19 strain, omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing more than 90% of cases of the omicron variant.
Education commentaries: What does it take to save abducted children?
If the analogy is made with the famous public service slogan "no sale, no killing", then, in a good environment without the demand for "trafficking", mass prevention and control, the whole people anti-trafficking, so that trafficking is unprofitable, risky, high cost, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created for the establishment of an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature and art", full of feelings, but also the application of information technology is appropriate, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim before the case of abduction and trafficking is solved.
Prioritizing matters, such as whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be subject to the death penalty or not, can be put aside for careful discussion under the urgent purpose of "seeking help "; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot be discussed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers tend to stay away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after they are successful.
An extra minute of delay in the search for abductions may make the child one step further away from the parents and make the case more difficult to solve.
In this context, it is indeed practical to come up with effective methods such as the "Reunion" platform that will directly help solve cases and find children.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a major task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
The fight against crime and the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of law, all need to carry out the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a railway station, and the parents are asleep, only to wake up to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he or she should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns of rest between parents or placing the child under safe protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of abduction and trafficking, the side that buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the legal penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty can be imposed and property confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, and under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a crime with a heavier penalty.
But there are still a lot of cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in their concept of raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, strict law enforcement by the authorities alone cannot be relied on.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, and the traffickers are motivated by profit, constantly innovate the means of trafficking, and form a "law-fighting" situation with the law-enforcers, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, the elimination of backward concepts and the popularization of common sense in the law will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and purchase of children.

Biden says freedom never goes out as democracy summit ends
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said he planned to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong, currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the job ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the small fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said defending democracy requires the concerted efforts of society as a whole.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffer and shock forces of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.", he said
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the themes were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uyghur and Tibetan minorities.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We have to use all [resources] we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Law also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
During a round-table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, a member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "National Statement" via video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against despotism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting COVID-19 through transparency and building trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to remove the shelf to defeat disinformation. "
As the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights abuses, and investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights abuses.

On the whole, China's residents in the level of financial consumption performance is good, but in the different aspects of financial behavior and skills reflect greater differences, but also need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation, although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the label of "excessive profligacy", but some young people do have excessive consumption and consumption behavior, and thus have excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even lead to a gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.

Vietnam People's Daily-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, it was Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal cohesion of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes leading to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by both countries in Qatar.
The resolution of differences among the Gulf Arab countries in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and is aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab states for believing it would not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a "competitor" and as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop of nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran that failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times in the same frequency resonance - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to the long-term accumulation of a university in the development process of a series of school-running ideas and value pursuit, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our university, it arose in the autumn of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde and save the world, cultivate Qi and rule peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "developing a powerful country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying on a global scale. As an important "supply side" of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "overall plan to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines" put forward, while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a major country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, so as to achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of latecomer, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape the brand, enhance the image; third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen the goal-driven, gather consensus, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catch up with the advanced level of the world.
In particular, we should realize that building a world-class university cannot be one-size-fits-all, and that each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target orientation, running a school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: first, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and school-enterprise integration, and form a chain-wide entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times with the same frequency resonance.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Virtue, Differentiation, and Truthfulness", as well as "Heiner River, Kai Zhen and High Virtue, Opening Things to the People, and Building Our Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for our use", and is reflected in the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Kai Zhen thick virtue" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and perfection, refers to the university in the pursuit of truth at the same time, but also to receive the edification of virtue and personality; "open things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including both knowledge innovation, scientific research innovation, but also performance of reform and development, reform and innovation; "tree my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, and says that the university should always be proud and humiliated with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The deaf hear in silence, and the bright see in the unformed".
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, the national spirit of mutual agitation, so as to achieve national prosperity and rejuvenation, the realization of the common ideal of mankind to provide an inexhaustible impetus.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions at 3 Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhuanet
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) --More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice on Wednesday to protest against discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three Ivy League schools--Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to prestigious U.S. schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants among the three prestigious U.S. schools has remained at the same level, Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference.
Many studies have shown that these universities "consistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
Zhao said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate of any ethnic group relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice to investigate the complaint and take measures to stop the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their admissions if they found the facts.
They also expect the universities complained of to take the initiative to pay attention to the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani descent in the United States also participated in the complaint.
After the "Democracy Summit" concluded on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw lines with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out'democratic transformation ', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated a'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become a'weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy problems, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been international and domestic skepticism, such as criticism of the inclusion of authoritarian leaders, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and doubts that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Just-in-office German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is full of pathologies, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalries, political polarization, social rifts, ethnic conflicts, and the polarization between rich and poor intensifying," China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday, saying that American democracy is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffer and shock forces of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We have to constantly renew it in every generation, and in my opinion, it is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges".
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year campaign after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of us deliver on our commitments and report on our progress next year".
Educational Reflections: How University Examinations Make "Academic Bullies" and "Academic Dregs" Work in Their Place - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, so that the examination truly reflects the actual level of students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test question type is single, the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the assault, if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning slag" usually do not invest can pass, or even get a high score; "learning bully" usually never fall out of class, homework, notes are good, the examination is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, Lanzhou Jiaotong University students reflect the problems in the university examination is not for nothing, I believe that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to university are aware that it is not uncommon to prepare for the test, think of various ways to "take" the test questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the test, and get "key guidance" before the test, even in the test with a small copy, after the test for the teacher's high hand is not a strange story.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guidance, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and on the scientific proposition on this basis.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many major courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject, is the content of the university examination to examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense, from the point of knowledge, the space for change is not big, basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "20 years ago, I studied the basics of college mathematics, but I'm still learning it, and I'm still focusing on it."
But the knowledge point is basically the same, does not mean that the test question type is single, the test question is repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually composed of a question group, and then the senior teacher of the subject co-ordinates the composition of the examination paper, and the examination review is also attended by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so as to overcome the duplication of the examination questions to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions according to the overall situation of students' learning, difficult and normal distribution, but also need to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, a comprehensive analysis of the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition on the difficult and dynamic grasp of the question type, not only can highlight the basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability to test, and innovative design of the question type.
Examination is the baton of university education, what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding test preparation program, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the student's letter of recommendation, and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of the final examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine the assessment of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test questions, repeated questions and so on is the issue that the university examination affairs need to face, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the effort is expensive in the daily, need teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, both sides to understand, teaching and learning will be better docking, form a benign interaction, the examination will be more in line with reality, so that the "student bully" and "student slag" in their respective places.
3,200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock because of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said it had been unable to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper had run out, and so far 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth papers were recorded in the system and would be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media outlet about the problem of raw paper printing in Sabah.
He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, leading to delays in their arrival in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah for raw paper is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
According to Kerouaminus, the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to collect the goods, return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, estimated to be two more working days (December 20) can be delivered to the applicant."
"We will inform applicants to go to all branches to collect the paper."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

The truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: Pipeline)
On December 11, a microdocumentary on the pipeline platform called "The Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism" launched the war in Afghanistan, through the war to forcibly export American democracy, 20 years of militarism, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committed all kinds of crimes against humanity.
The indiscriminate use of drones in air strikes on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and sets up killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity have provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "more anti-terrorist".
The war did not bring hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful learning books.
Many of today's success books promote the "best principle"-that is, assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that all of a sudden across the "how to do", in fact, the most important and fundamental link.
For this reason, these books all have one thing in common--either do it at its best, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle," anyone who looks at it will admit that it is "absolutely right," but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation," which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conformist, conformist, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in their ears, which is no doubt self-deception, playing the piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "change" cowardly, hesitant, difficult to resolve; or with a temporary impulse pain under the "change" determination, and brave to take the first step, but often short-lived, can not persist for a while to lose the battle, it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "From Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the capacity of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is one way to put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold"-it encourages a "small win for a big win" theory, that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dune on your doorstep, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, so there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It is only a little longer to follow the "second-best principle" of success.
All in all, the "best principle", while ostensibly designed to make everyone successful, ultimately inspires a small number of people, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
Qinghai Lake naked carp reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves this year increased by 0.71 million tons over the previous year, to 108,500 tons, compared with the initial protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangshui fish", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and killing, and the degradation of the environment in the waters where naked carp breed. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species on the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers into Qinghai Lake, the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continue to increase protection efforts, Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake has accumulated nearly 180 million tails of artificial proliferation and release, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the spread of desertification in the west and east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor body is slow, rich in color, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.

If you want to shoot a gorgeous'meteor shower blockbuster ', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, shooting with a high ISO and maximum aperture.
Tripod, spare battery and shutter cable are also essential for stability and continuity. "
