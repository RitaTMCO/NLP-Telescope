Is there a way to punish him?
So that such a thing won’t happen again.
And how much longer does it take for the restaurant to prepare it? Could could help me ask them?
Please arrange a refund soon, thx.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, and I don’t want points and I will not use it again #PRS_ORG#!
There are bones and kimchi in it and it’s not suitable for children.
If so, please place an order soon.
We don’t have it at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I am done waiting, and I’ll cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I left the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, sorry for the inconvenience.
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#.
There is only one 13-yuan shrimp dumpling! ?
I haven’t tried it before.
How can you not write your #NAME# clearly?
Is it 13 yuan for only one?
Yesterday  #PRS_ORG# missed some food in the delivery, and now I only have one shrimp dumping! ?
Because I clearly saw the code was valid when I entered it.
If we just give you the offset amount of the order, what does that mean?
Is it Okay?
I received them, but all my three bottles of drinks were spilled.
My App says it’s delivered, but I haven’t received it.
I just ordered food and I didn’t know it was hung on the door handle.
and ask for a re-delivery
I live in Shangshui, and why is the order in Haihui Garden?
Is the address wrong?
Rice with roast pork is now rice with pork and kimchi.
Would it be possible that you can only use it when you buy $100 or $200?
It’s worrying, how long do I have to wait before it arrives?
Okay, thanks for the help.
Will the same delivery person deliver it to me?
Could you help follow up on it?
The restaurant said the food had been cooked for more than half an hour.
But no delivery person came to the store to pick it up.
The food is cold, and food can go bad.
Meal order #NUMBER# was originally estimated to be delivered by 18:40, and now it is estimated to arrive by 19:15!
Dinner time is limited, so please hurry up and deal with it!
I didn’t receive it.
I only placed the order 5 minutes ago, so how is it completed already?
Where can I see the details of the actual discount code?
Actually, I don’t what went wrong, the restaurant or the delivery person.
There is no receipt on the bag.
It can’t be traced.
I hope you can find out about it.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than what is displayed.
Nothing else, thanks.
Yes, the delivery person has been changed.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant always said they were processing it.
Waited for a few hours.
I have take a photo and submitted to you.
I know that.
But I don’t know why the restaurant kept putting off the delivery time.
It was originally #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I won’t do it.
I’m good now.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn’t you say it earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
I’ve waited so long for you.
No, I didn’t receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don’t want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
I’ve waited one and a half hours for one meal.
#PRS_ORG# is not delivered.
I want to cancel the order.
Why can’t I cancel it?
Hi, the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered from the restaurant is raw.
The delivery time of the order has been put off multiple times.
Could you help follow up on it?
Delayed.
Thank you.
That is to say, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to re-place the order next? So I can just ignore the previous order, right?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, and after I received the delivery I found a lot of things were missing and the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I wanted to pick it up myself for no reason at all, please cancel it.
All my orders are delivery orders, and there has been no request of self pickup.
It will be one hour and #NUMBER# minutes if I have to wait another 20 minutes.
I don’t want food made one hour earlier.
I found the buyer with the wrong order.
But my wheel pie is missing.
Hello, how much longer will the ordered food arrive?
They have wrapped up.
The number and name of your delivery person is #PHONENUMBER# and #NAME#.
Please offer me a reasonable solution.
Sure, but your delivery person has some issue that needs to be dealt with.
Could you check if it’s still on the road first? If that’s okay, just deliver it.
OK, if there is really not, please return the money for the order.
Why does it take so long?
I’ve starving to death.
From the estimated 7:30 until now.
Don’t take it if it’s not possible.
I can go out and buy a meal, and don’t have to wait here #PRS_ORG#.
Is there only one shrimp dumpling in the order?
Why are there six wontons？
I won’t go.
I placed a delivery order.
No one contacted me during this one hour, and this is online fraud.
You think this is the first time that I have ordered food?
You said that after the investigation! I checked the address multiple times before placing the order.
Okay, thank you! How many days?
It hasn’t arrived since 7 o’clock and now it’s 9:30, and you must refund the deposit and cancel the order.
OK.
I ordered a set meal and two of the delivered items were wrong.
Order
Want to pay service fee to the delivery person.
How can I pay now?
I haven’t received the delivery.
Please contact the delivery person.
Yes, the order status is accepted.
But the restaurant called saying the delivery person did not deliver bones, and so the restaurant needed to separate the bones and meat and discard the bones.
Do you understand my question?
It’s not that the order was delayed.
Or you can just call me.
Are you following up on it?
Does he have the correct address?
It was not seen yet.
That delivery person went to the wrong place, so I didn’t receive it.
But I #PRS_ORG# received it.
App is not able to contact the delivery person for the time being.
My family thought there was none.
But it has already been 1 hour.
McNuggets, without the McNuggets sauce.
The McNuggets would taste horrible without the sauce.
Is your $32 discount code only applicable when your order reaches certain amount?
You can cancel it if it doesn’t arrive in 15 minutes.
I was entering the code, and why does it change to order confirmation?
OK.
Then I won’t enjoy the discount?
Hello,
the ordered food was not delivered.
the delivery person has made the delivery.
I hope you can be on time, and it’s not that I want your coupons! !
Please arrange the delivery.
My order has not arrived.
The delivery person has left, but the good was not delivered.
Please immediately notify the delivery person that we are still waiting.
The restaurant has given the food to the delivery person 30 minutes ago.
I need tableware.
I just canceled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you check for me if it has been canceled?
But I placed the order at 5:9 in the morning.
That was the order hotline, and they said they didn’t know anything.
Is there a number I can call to contact them directly?
OK, I just worry that he will deliver it to the wrong address.
If you cannot change the location of the branch store for me, can I change it to delivery?
Then I don’t need to pay again, right?
My colleague has delivered all the orders.
I can’t pull it to complete.
Where is GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Then what are the conditions for using the $32 one?
That’s fine, and there is no need to refund it.
Your delivery person said it couldn’t be found.
Can’t find it.
But I don’t understand his English.
Do I need to return the curry soup to you?
I only received a half.
Six boxes were missing from the delivery.
The company is working overtime; I haven’t had lunch, wanted to get delivery, and didn’t expect the order was canceled.
So, can the system see new orders?
So what would you do with the delivery person?
I don’t think I can accept the order still not being delivered after another 20 minutes.
I’ve been waiting since 7 o’clock.
Will it arrive soon?
I meant the food.
I waited again across the #PRS_ORG#.
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it has prepared
Then I will use my points to re-place the order, thank you.
What is the pickup address?
I can’t see the address.
Can it be delivered between 10 to 15 minutes?
I have not received the food.
The point is I didn’t eat anything tonight.
If it can’t be delivered, just say it sooner.
So disappointed.
Will you arrange a refund?
I can only be satisfied! Even the delivery fee is 20 yuan.
There’s no other way! Help me ask that restaurant.
Thank you for following up, and certainly some delivery people have been excellent as well.
Hello, I’ve waited a very long time for this order.
Constantly delayed.
Thanks.
Please help me cancel it; every order needs to be re-placed.
Will I only get credit after he places the order?
Was this order missed in the delivery?
When can it be delivered?
not possible
This code includes 4 discounts of $20 off.
#NAME# said to re-place the order for me.
Re-placing the order charged me so much again.
But I placed the order a little past one o’clock.
The delivery was late, and after the food got cold, it was dry and hard, completely inedible.
Also the soup was spilled.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff he #PRS_ORG# resends here must be cold.
I didn’t take it!
#NAME# said no one went to pick it up.
We called.
I’ll call the police if you don’t refund it.
I’ve used #PRS_ORG# many times, and today I had the worst experience.
Totally unacceptable.
Okay, fine.
But you need to remind the restaurant and delivery person.
To prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
The time kept being put off.
I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait.
If I cancel the order, can I get the money back?
I want to pay service fee to the delivery person, how can I do it?
It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.
Not willing to wait any longer.
Do I need to re-place the order now?
The phone was not answered.
Kept being delayed.
Still not delivered.
May I ask when it will arrive?
How do I gain contact?
Please cancel the order.
I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
He still has two food orders to deliver, but one order has completed.
I want to know how to contact the delivery person.
The first delivery person told me that another delivery person would send it again.
I ordered food worth over $180 with #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.
But the order didn’t deduct the $20.
The restaurant only gave me one bag of it, and it needs to be put in a bag because it’s cold.
May I ask if the food delivery was put in one bag?
We only see one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or someone took it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour and it still has not been delivered yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Please place another order for the children.
I hope the store can set aside some time out of its busy schedule to check the quality of the products.
If the food is not warm, can I cancel it?
I don’t want it anymore, he didn’t come up and deliver it to me because parking was not allowed down there.
#NUMBER# yuan has been received, and it was for the missed food.
One thing was missing, and even the McNuggets was charged.
Ask the restaurant to send it up here.
I don’t want to go downstairs to shop, which is why I spend so much in delivery.
I'm again across the #PRS_ORG#.
Hi.
The order time keeps increasing.
How long will it take for it to arrive?
It said it would arrive between 16:10 to 16:30 originally.
I’ll wait until 7:30 and see it will arrive.
What does Sheng Street lead to?
Which street in Hong Kong leads to Sheng Street?
May I ask what the status of the order is now?
I entered it in December.
So, this month I can enjoy 4 discounts of $20 off with the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.
I haven’t received the order, and could you help check if the rider is still on the way here?
Hello, could you help contact the rider and ask if he or she is still on the road?
I haven’t received the order, and I’ve checked there was no food and no one contacted me to cancel it.
Normally the administration office downstairs would call me when there’s a delivery and let the delivery person in after asking me, but administration office has not contacted me.
#PRS_ORG# can testify for me, no one took it after it’s prepared, and #PRS_ORG# wronged me saying I took it myself.
I’ll say it again, I placed a delivery order.
They made it, but you didn’t send anyone to take the food and wronged me saying I went to pick it up myself.
I demand you to cancel it immediately, or I’ll call the police.
How should I pay?
The de-delivered food has arrived.
No delivery person received it.
Now the restaurant employee is calling me.
I said it should arrive before 1 o’clock, and I’ve seen it in the App.
What is the...
I haven’t finished speaking, what are you doing?
I ordered axe-handle steak.
The restaurant told me the delivery person could not deliver bones.
I want to ask why.
The bones are okay, ask the restaurant to wrap them up separately and deliver them.
But the system was not easy to use, and I normally used the other room.
I’m at #ADDRESS#, the branch store at Meixinli.
I’m far from that place.
The address is wrong.
Hello,
Can I cancel the order?
I will re-place the order.
Is it canceled yet?
I won’t wait any more.
It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06😅
The takeout order never arrived.
Even the number of the delivery person is fake.
I have already re-placed the order.
Will I get a refund for the last order?
If it doesn’t work, please cancel the order and ask for a refund.
I thought if I ordered early, I could eat it early, but now it’s 7 and I still don’t have it.
I don’t understand what you are talking about...
Was your Chinese translated? Or would you prefer English?
Then send it to
Shall I tell him on the phone?
I don’t think this act is helpful at all!
What I received is tripe.
The order is chicken feet.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in this conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain it.
Your delivery person told me the address is too far.
It’s so horrible, and I will cancel the order if it doesn’t arrive in 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don’t cancel this conversation, and I’ll pursue it further if I don’t receive the refund in 5 to 10 days.
I asked if I could cancel it if it didn’t arrive in 15 minutes.
Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce is supposed to be fully cooked, but what I received is raw and inedible.
There has been no replies for three days, and as your system cannot identify my credit card, I can’t join the#PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee project!
What is strange is that I paid with the same credit card every time.
I have to pay the delivery fee every time now.
It can be exempted, and you can charge me with the monthly fee after the investigation, is that Okay?
Then how can I contact the food delivery person?
It’s almost three o’clock.
Then should you give me compensation?
I said to knock before handing me the delivery.
But the delivery person just left it at the door and left.
And got it wrong.
Your delivery person has picked up an order of mine at  #NUMBER#, but I was told I still needed to wait.
The delivery person picked up my takeout at 19:25, but still doesn’t want to set out.
I’ll go buy it, and do you need any other takeout?
What do I do?
Where is your delivery person?
Do I still need to wait?
I asked for the food to be delivered.
Okay, if you don’t cancel it, I’ll call the police.
But there will be safety and health issues in my food.
It will be okay after the discount code is reimbursed.
No problem, and remember not to arrange for a re-delivery, I have re-purchased it and I don’t want to cause any waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have reported it and attached the pictures, but there has been no reply.
What beef, I didn’t order beef.
It is Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce, and it’s raw.
It’s inedible.
Are you sure the food was freshly cooked and not from before?
That’s unacceptable.
I’ve placed the order very early.
It said it would be de delivered a little over seven o’clock.
Why does it have to be re-made?
It’s ridiculous.
Hello.
I’ve placed an order just now, and it showed the delivery person was waiting at the restaurant, but the restaurant said the order was prepared and they didn’t see the delivery person.
Could you help follow up on it because I’m in a hurry, thank you.
They will probably be late for half an hour for no reason at all.
Have you actually solved any problem?
I have given it to my client, #PRS_ORG# and I can’t pull it to complete.
I did it, I have delivered it.
If it can be delivered within 20 minutes, I won’t cancel it.
I’ll cancel it~ I’ve waited for a long time.
You kept putting it off.
But the Poached Chicken in Chili Sauce is just a box of inedible raw chicken, and can I get a refund for it?
Pineapple, tamagoyaki and steamed buns have not arrived, #PRS_ORG# returned #NUMBER# yuan
But can I ask for a refund of the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce?
Because it is so raw that it is not edible.
If I want to cancel it? Is it okay?
