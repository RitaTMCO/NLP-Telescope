Is there a way to punish him
Don't let this happen again
Or how long does it take for the restaurant to be ready? Could you please ask me?
Please arrange a refund for me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, no more use of #PRS_ORG#!
Boneless and spicy noodles are not suitable for children
If so, please order as soon as possible
Not for the time being, thank you
He asked me to tell you where he is PRS ORG
I won't wait, cancel the order
I bought PRS_ORG, but I wrote the wrong address
Can I change it?
or cancel your order
Okay, I'm in trouble.
I've ordered ##NUMBER#
One shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
i've never tried it.
Why can't #NAME# be spelled out clearly?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# miss delivery of food, this time just a shrimp dumpling to eat me!?
Because it's clear that what I saw when I first entered the code is valid
What do you mean if we just refund your order?
can you do that?
Roger that, but my three drinks are all spilled
My app appears to have been delivered, but I haven't received it yet
I just ordered a sale, and I didn't know it was on the doorstep
And then I'll send it back.
I live in Sheung Shui. Why are orders placed in Haihui Garden
Is the address wrong?
Roast five-flowered meat rice Variety of broiled cabbage five-flowered meat rice
Will I have to buy enough $100 or $200 to use it
Worryingly, how long will it take to get it done
Okay, I'm in trouble.
Is it the same rider who gave it to me?
May I help you to follow up?
The restaurant says the food has been cooked for over half an hour
But no cyclist came to the store to pick up the food
The food is cold, and it is likely to get spoiled
The menu #NUMBER# was originally expected to be served at 6:40 p.m., changed once and is now expected to be served at 7:15 p.m.
Dinner time is limited, please make arrangements as soon as possible!
i didn't receive it.
The order only took five minutes. How could it have been completed
Actual discount code Where can I see the details
Actually, I don't know if it's the shop fault or the rider's fault
There are no documents on the bag
i can't track it.
I hope you'll understand.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than the display.

Yes, we have a new rider
He has been waiting a long time
The restaurant always said it was in process
We waited a few hours.
We've taken pictures and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying delivery
Originally, it was #number#
Anyway, I didn't call
i haven't eaten.
I'm sure I'll complain
You can't send it, why don't you speak sooner
i've been waiting for you so long
No, I didn't get a call
Please inform him to send it back to our company
I don't want to wait another #number# minute
A meal waited an hour and a half
#PRS_ORG# hasn't been sent yet
I want to cancel my order
Why not cancel it
Hello, the mouthwatering chicken from the restaurant is fresh

I found the buyer of the previous wrong order
But my biscuits are gone
Hello, how long will it take for the ordered meal to be delivered
The house is finished
Your cyclist's phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, your name is #NAME#
Please give me a reasonable explanation
Yes, but your riders are in trouble, so please take care of them
Can you check it first to see if it's still on the way? If so, it'd be best to deliver it
OK, if you don't, we'll give you back the money you ordered
why so long?
I'm starving.
From the estimated 7:30 to the present
Don't pick it up if you can't
I can go out and buy food myself, I don't have to be here PRS_ORG
Is there only one shrimp dumpling order?
Why do you have six handcuffs?
I won't go
I'm on the delivery.
No one's contacted me in the last hour. It's just a scam on the Internet
You think that's the first time I've been called a salesman?
That's what you'll say when you've done the research! Before I made the order, I checked the address several times before I could make the order
Okay, thank you! How many days was that?
From 7 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. it hasn't been delivered yet. You have to refund your deposit and cancel your order

I ordered a package, but two items were delivered incorrectly
Order
Want to pay the rider for the service
How can I pay now
We haven't received the sale yet
Please contact the rider
Yes, the order is accepted
But the restaurant called and said that because the riders weren't delivering the bones, the restaurant needed to cut the meat and bones off and discard them
Do you understand my question
It's not an order delay
Or you can call me directly
Are you following?
Does he have the correct address?
i haven't seen it yet.
The cyclist just went to the wrong place, so I didn't receive it
But I got it from PRS-ORG.
The app was temporarily unable to contact the rider
My family didn't think so
But it's been over an hour.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
If that barley chicken were to be eaten dry, it would be very hard to eat
Do you have to buy enough money to use your $32 coupon code
Can it be cancelled in less than 15 minutes

The ordered meal was not delivered
the rider's been delivered.
I hope you can be on time, not want your coupons!!
Please arrange delivery
my order hasn't arrived
The delivery man has gone and hasn't delivered the goods
Please notify the delivery person immediately, we are still waiting
The restaurant had given food to the rider 30 minutes ago.
Required tableware
I've just cancelled my order
Why is it still in effect
Can you help me see if it's canceled
But I already ordered at 5: 9 in the morning
There's a reservation hotline over there. They don't know what to say
Do you have a phone number to contact them directly?
All right, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address
If I can't change the location of my branch, can I change it to an outsourced one?
So I don't have to give you any more money?
My colleague's order has been delivered
You won't be able to pull it.
What about GPS? It's not there yet.
That's $32. What conditions have to be met before you can use it
All right, there's no refund.
Your rider said he couldn't find it
i can't find it.
But I couldn't understand his English
Shall I return the curry sauce to you?
i only received half of it
there's six boxes i haven't seen.
The company is working overtime, and no meals are served at noon. Who knows if the order will be cancelled
So, is the system able to see new orders
So how do you deal with that rider
I don't think I can accept orders that don't arrive in 20 minutes
From 7 o'clock on until now
Isn't that coming soon?
I'm talking about food.
I'm in front of PRS.
Well, thanks, because the restaurant says it's ready
So I'll re-order with the points, thank you
Where is the retrieval address?
I can't see the address.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
Unreceived food
The point is, I didn't have dinner tonight
If you can't deliver it, you can say so sooner.
Disappointment
Will you arrange a refund?
You can't be dissatisfied! The shipping fee is 20 yuan.
There's no way! Ask me about the restaurant
Thank you for following me, and of course some of the riders have done very well
Hello, I've been waiting for this order for a long time

Please help me cancel, re-order every order
He needs an order before I can get credit?
Did you miss the bill?
How long do you think it'll take to deliver
It's not possible
This code includes four $20 discounts
#NAME# Tell me to re-order
I re-ordered and received so much money
But I ordered one more.
The meal was late, and the food was cold, and when it was cold, it was so dry and hard that it was impossible to eat
And the soup is sprinkled out
Cancel immediately, he must have cooled the supplies.
I didn't take it!
# Name # Says no one's going to take it
We made a phone call
If you don't return the money, I'll call the police
Repeatedly using PRS_ORG, this time it was the worst experience
totally unacceptable.

But also remind restaurants and cyclists
Avoid it happening again
I'd like to know the exact delivery time
That time is constantly delayed
I don't know when to wait
If you cancel your order, you can't get a refund
You want to pay the service fee to the rider, how do you do it?
It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a cyclist
I don't want to wait any longer
So do I need to re-order now?
Nobody answers the phone
Uninterrupted delay
it hasn't been delivered yet.
When will it be delivered, please?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel your order
I can't wait any longer, thank you
He hasn't delivered two meals, but one order has been completed
I'd like to know how to contact the rider
Just now the first cyclist told me that there should be another cyclist to deliver it
I ordered food over $180 with my PRS_ORG# RED credit card.
But the order didn't deduct $20
The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag because the weather was cold
I'd like to ask, is it packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag
I'd like to know if it's a leak or if someone took it from us,thanks
It's been an hour. It hasn't been delivered yet.
Today is the winter solstice. It's disappointing to make mistakes
Order another meal for the little ones
I hope the store will check the listings in all its busyness
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because there's no parking downstairs
#NUMBER# The yuan has been received. It is the food that has been leaked
The less you give, the more money you'll need for a malt sauce
You asked the restaurant to bring it up
It's because I don't want to go downstairs to buy things that I spend so much money on outsourcing
I'm on the other side of PRS.
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Please, the order time is continuously extended
How long will it take to get there?
The original booking said 16:10-16:30
So I'll wait till 7:30 to see if it can be delivered
Where's Saint Street?
Which street in Hong Kong leads to Saint Street?
A: Excuse me, what's the status of the order now
I entered it in December
So, this month you can use the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card 4 times to enjoy a $20 discount
I haven't received the order. Can you help me check if the rider is still on his way
Hi, can you help me contact the rider and ask if he's still on his way?
I haven't received an order yet. I haven't had a meal yet. No one has contacted me about the cancellation
Normally there are out-sales, downstairs management office will call, after the question will let people in first, but management office has not contacted me ah
There are #PRS_ORG# to testify, do well, no one to take, #PRS_ORG# wrong I become self-serving
I repeat, I'm sending you a receipt
When it's done, you don't take it to someone else for dinner, and then you blame me
I'm asking you to cancel immediately or I'll call the police
How do I get the money?
The repackaged meal has been delivered
No riders accepted
The restaurant clerk is calling me now
I said 1 o'clock. I saw it on the app.
what's your name?
I haven't finished. what are you doing?
I ordered an axe picker
The restaurant told me that cyclists can't deliver bones
Want to know the reason
The bones are fine. We'll have the restaurant pack it up and deliver it.
But the system is not very convenient, all use another room
I'm at the ADDRESS branch in new york.

Even the cyclist's phone numbers are fake
I've re-ordered
Will the above form be refunded?
If not, please cancel the order and refund
I thought I'd order it early, I could eat it early, but now it's seven o'clock and I haven't eaten it yet
I don't understand what you're saying...
Do you translate your Chinese or do you prefer to use English?
that's sent to
Would you like to call him
I don't think this will help at all!
Receipt is the belly of money
the order is a feather claw
Okay, the phone is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain
Your rider told me the address was too far
So terrifying, please cancel your order in less than 30 minutes!
Isn't there another way? For example, by changing the address?
OK, then don't cancel the conversation. If you haven't returned my money in 5 to 10 days, you'll be prosecuted.
I asked if it would be possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes
The mouthwatering chicken is supposed to be ripe, but the meat is raw and can't be eaten
No reply for 3 days...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
Now I have to pay the shipping fee every time
I'll be exempted and charged my monthly fee once you've done your research, okay?
How can I get in touch with the waiter
it's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to give me compensation
I said knock on the door to deliver the goods
But the cyclist put it at the door, and then the people left
Incorrect delivery
Your riders already took me out on #NUMBER#, but I've been told they're still waiting
The rider had received my offer at 7:25 p.m., but still refused to leave
I'll go and buy it. Do you need any other outsourcing
what do you do?
Where did your rider go
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I want to send a receipt
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But there are health and safety issues with my food
All you have to do is retrieve the coupon code
No problem, remember there's no need to re-order, I've already bought another one, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help.
I have reported and attached the picture, but there is no reply
what cow, no cow
it's turkey, raw meat.
I can't eat it
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
unacceptable
It's already been ordered this morning.
It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock.

It's seven o'clock. It's seven o'clock
Why remake it?
it's too far apart.

I just placed an order showing that the rider was waiting in the restaurant, but the restaurant said the order was ready and I didn't see the rider
Can you help me to follow up, because I'm in a hurry, thank you
It's possible to be half an hour late for no reason
Do you actually have a solution?
It's been delivered to my guest, PRS ORG, but it's not ready yet.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
If it can be delivered within 20 minutes, it will not be cancelled.
I cancelled - I waited a long time
You keep postponing
But the whole box of mouthwatering chicken is raw meat, it can not be eaten, can you refund the money
The pineapple, the jade roast and the steamed buns didn't arrive, so the PRS organization withdrew the yuan
However, is there a refund for mouth watering chicken?
'Cause when you're born, you can't eat
Can I cancel if I want?
