Is there any means to punish him?
So that such a thing won’t happen again.
Or how long will it take the restaurant to prepare the foods? Could you please ask them for me?
Please arrange for a refund to me soon, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund, I don’t want the points, and I will not use it again #PRS_ORG#!
There are bones and spicy pickles, not suitable for children.
If so, please place an order soon.
We don’t have it at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I won’t wait, and I’ll cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote a wrong address.
Can I change the order?
Or can I cancel the order?
Okay, sorry for the inconvenience.
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#.
The shrimp dumpling of 13 yuan included only one! ?
I haven’t tried it before.
Why didn’t #NAME# say it clearly?
13 yuan for only one?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed some foods, and you give me only one shrimp dumpling today! ?
I found it valid when I entered the code before.
What do you mean if we just offset your order?
Is it Okay?
I’ve received it, but all my three bottles of drinks were spilled.
It is shown as being delivered in my APP, but I haven’t received it, yet.
I ordered a take-out just now, but I did expect that it was hung on the door.
and I asked for a re-delivery.
I live in Shangshui, but the address in the order is Haihui Garden.
Is there anything wrong about the address?
The braised streaky port meal is changed to pickle  streaky port meal.
Can I use it only after I buy things of $100 or $200?
I’m worried about how long will it be delivered to me.
Okay, thanks.
Will my order be delivered by the same deliveryman?
Could you help follow up on it?
An employee of the restaurant said the food was ready more than half an hour ago.
But no deliveryman came to the restaurant to pick it up.
The food is cold, and may go bad.
The order #NUMBER# was changed to be delivered to the customer at 19:15 from originally to be delivered at 18:40%
I have limited time for my dinner, and please deal with it as soon as possible!
I haven’t received it, yet.
How does the order show completed, since I placed the order 5 minutes ago?
Where can I see the details of the actual discount code?
In fact, I don’t know who made the mistake, the restaurant or the deliveryman.
There is no receipt on the bag.
I can’t trace it.
I hope that you can know something about it.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes earlier than the shown time.
Nothing else, thanks.
It is another deliveryman who will deliver it to you.
He has waited for long.
The restaurant always said my order was being processed.
I’ve waited for hours.
I have taken photos and submitted them to you.
I know that.
But I don’t know why the restaurant delayed the delivery time repeatedly.
I ordered #NUMBER# at first.
Anyway, I won’t place the order.
I don’t want to eat.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn’t you tell me earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
I’ve waited so long.
No, I didn’t receive the call.
Please ask him to deliver it to my company again.
I don’t want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
I’ve waited for one and a half hours for my foods.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered.
I want to cancel my order.
Why can’t I cancel it?
Hi, the Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered by the restaurant is raw and inedible.
The order has been delayed repeatedly.
Could you help follow up on it?
Delayed.
Thank you.
That is to say, I’ve had the credit?
Do I need to place the order again, now? I don’t need to do anything about the previous order, right?
Hi, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but lots of my ordered foods are missing, and the Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce is raw and inedible.
#PRS_ORG# required me to pick it up by myself with no reason, and please cancel it.
I placed a delivery order, and I know nothing about self pick-up.
I’ve waited for one hour and #NUMBER# in 20 minutes.
I don’t want the food cooked one hour ago.
I’ve found the buyer with the incorrect order.
But I cannot find my wheel cake.
Hello, how long I need to wait for my food?
The restaurant has finished work.
The telephone number of your deliveryman is  #PHONENUMBER#, and the name is #NAME#.
Can you give me a reasonable explanation?
Okay, but there was something wrong with your deliveryman, and please deal with it.
Could you please check if it’s still on the way? If it is on the way, just deliver it.
OK, if there is really not, please refund.
Why did it take so long?
I’m starving to death.
From the estimated time of 7:30 until now.
Don’t accept it if you cannot finish it as schedule.
I can go out and buy food, and don’t have to wait here #PRS_ORG#.
Is there only one shrimp dumpling in the dish?
Why are there six wontons in one dish?
I won’t go.
I make delivery according to delivery orders.
No one contacted me during this one hour, and this is online fraud.
Do you think this is the first time for me to order take-out?
You said so after the investigation! I had checked the address repeatedly before I placed the order.
Okay, thank you! How many days is it?
I placed the order at 7 o’clock, but it has not been delivered now, at 9:30, and you shall refund and cancel the order.
Okay.
I’ve ordered a set meal, but 2 foods in it are wrong.
Order
I want to pay for the service charge to the deliveryman.
How can I pay now?
I’ve not received my take-out, yet.
Please contact with the deliveryman.
Yes, the order was in the status of accepted.
But a staff of the restaurant told me that the deliveryman did not deliver foods with bones, so he needed to separate meat from bones and then abandons the bones.
Do you know what I say?
It’s not about the delay of the order.
Or you can call me directly.
Are you following up on it?
Does he know the correct address?
I’ve not seen it, yet.
That deliveryman went to a wrong address, and I’ve not received my order.
But I #PRS_ORG# received it.
The App cannot contact with the food deliveryman now.
My family members thought there was none.
But I’ve waited for 1 hour.
There is no sauce for the Chicken McNuggets
The McNuggets tastes really horrible without the sauce.
Is the $32 discount code applicable only when my order reaches certain amount?
Can I cancel the order if it is not delivered to me within 15 minutes?
I was entering the code, but why did it change to order confirmation?
OK.
Then I cannot enjoy the discount?
Hello.
The foods I ordered have not been delivered yet.
The food deliveryman has made the delivery.
What I want is that you can deliver my order in time, but not your discount coupon! !
Please arrange for the delivery.
My order has not been delivered to me, yet.
The deliveryman has left, but my order has not been delivered to me.
Please tell the deliveryman that we are still waiting.
The deliveryman picked up the foods from the restaurant 30 minutes ago.
Tableware is needed.
I just cancelled the order.
Why is it still in processing?
Can you check if it has been cancelled for me?
But I placed the order at 05:09 this morning.
The person picking up the food ordering hotline said he had no idea about it.
Do you know their telephone number so that I can call them directly?
Okay, I’m just afraid that he may deliver it to a wrong address.
If you cannot change the position of the branch, can you change it into take-out?
So I don’t need to give additional money, right?
My colleagues have delivered all their orders.
I can’t pull it to completed.
Where is GPS? Has it arrived?
What conditions shall be met if I want to use the discount of $32?
Okay, you don’t need to refund to me.
Your rider said that he could not find it.
He couldn't find it.
But I cannot understand his oral English.
Do I need to return the curry soup base to you?
I’ve received only a half.
Six boxes were not delivered.
I worked overtime at noon, and I had nothing to eat for my lunch, so I wanted to order take-out, but I didn’t expect that my order was canceled.
And can the system see new orders?
So what would you do to deal with the deliveryman?
I think I can at most wait for additional 20 minutes for my order.
From 7 o’clock till now.
Will it be delivered to me soon?
I meant the foods.
Then I waited opposite to #PRS_ORG#.
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant staff said it was ready.
Then I place the order again with my member points now, thank you.
Where is the pick-up address?
I cannot see the address.
Can I receive my food in 10 to 15 minutes?
I’ve not received my foods.
The most important thing is that I had nothing to eat for my diner this evening.
You should have told me earlier if you cannot deliver it as schedule.
I’m really disappointed.
Will you refund to me?
I can only be satisfied! Even the delivery fee is 20 yuan.
There’s no other way! Ask that restaurant for me, please.
Thank you for your follow-up, and some food deliverymen are really excellent in work.
Hello, I’ve waited so long for my order.
It has been delayed repeatedly.
Thanks.
Please cancel it for me, and I’ll re-place each order.
Can I get credit only when he places an order?
Is this order missed?
When will it be delivered?
Impossible
This code includes 4 discounts of $20 off.
#NAME# said to re-place the order for me.
Re-placing the order charged me so much again.
But I placed the order a little past one o’clock.
The delivery was late, and the food changed dry and hard after it got cold, completely inedible.
And the soup was spilled.
Cancel it immediately, and the foods he #PRS_ORG# supplemented were cold.
I’ve never received it!
#NAME# said no one of you went there and picked it up.
We called them.
I’ll call the police if you don’t give me a refund.
I’ve used #PRS_ORG# for many times, but I had the worst experience today.
It was totally unacceptable.
Okay, fine.
But please remind the restaurant and the deliveryman.
To prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
The time has been delayed repeatedly.
I don’t know how much longer will I have to wait.
Can you refund if the order is cancelled?
How can I pay for the service charge to the deliveryman now?
It was confirmed that there was one deliveryman one hour ago.
I don’t want to wait any longer.
Do I need to re-place my order now?
The phone was not answered.
It has been delayed repeatedly.
Still not delivered to me.
May I ask when will it be delivered to me?
How do I contact them, then?
Please cancel the order.
I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
He still has two orders to deliver, but one of them has been completed.
Please tell me how can I contact with the deliveryman?
The first deliveryman told me that another deliveryman would deliver it to me.
I’ve ordered foods for more than $180 with the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.
But no $20 is deducted in my order.
The restaurant gave me only one bag to keep the foods, and it’s really cold.
May I ask if my take-out was put in one bag?
We see only one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or someone took it away, thanks.
It’s 1 hour, and I have not received my foods, yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is really disappointing.
I have to place another order for the children.
Please make sure to check the quality of the products.
Can I cancel the order if the foods are not warm?
I don’t want it anymore, he could not deliver it to me because parking is not allowed here downstairs.
#NUMBER# yuan has been received, for missing foods.
One box of Chicken McNuggets source is charged, but one thing in my order is missing.
Ask the restaurant to deliver it up here to me.
I spent so much to order take-out just because I don’t want to go downstairs to buy foods.
Then I waited opposite to #PRS_ORG#.
Hello
The order has been delayed repeatedly
How long can I receive it?
I was told that the order would be delivered to me between 16:10 to 16:30 originally.
Then I’ll wait for my order to 07:30.
Where does the Saint. Street lead to?
Which street in Hong Kong leads to the Saint. Street?
What’s the status of the order?
I entered it in December.
So,I can enjoy 4 discounts of $20 off with the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card this month.
I’ve not received my order, and can you check if the rider is still on the way?
Hello, can you contact with the rider to check if he is still on the way?
I’ve not received my order, and I’m told that the foods I ordered are sold out, but nobody contacted with me to tell me anything about the cancellation of my order.
Usually, if there is a delivery for me, the Management Office downstairs will call me and then ask the rider to deliver foods to me, but the Management Office did not contact with me today.
With the witness of #PRS_ORG#, the order was ready but nobody went to get it, and I was wronged to change the order to self pick-up.
I’m saying it again that I placed a delivery order.
The restaurant made it, but you didn’t send anyone to take the food and wronged me that I placed a self pick-up order.
I require you to cancel it now, or I’ll call the police.
How should I pay for it?
The de-delivered food has arrived.
No deliveryman accepted the task.
An employee of the restaurant is calling me.
I required my food to arrive before 1 o’clock, which I can see in the App.
What do you mean
I’ve not finished talking, what are you doing?
I ordered axe-handle steak.
A staff of the restaurant told me that deliveryman could not deliver foods with bones.
I want to know the reason.
The bones can be packaged and delivered separately.
But the system was not available, and I normally used the other room.
I’m in #ADDRESS#, the branch in Meixinli.
I’m far away from that place.
The address is wrong.
Hello.
Can I cancel the order?
I will place the order again.
Has it been canceled yet?
I won’t wait any more.
It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 17:06😅
My take-out has never been delivered to me.
Even the telephone number of the deliveryman is false.
I have already placed the order again.
Will the previous order refunded?
If it does not work, please cancel the order and then apply for refunding.
I thought to have my breakfast earlier so I placed the order very early, but I haven’t received my breakfast until 7 o’clock.
I don’t know what are you talking about......
Is your Chinese translated from English? Or do you just prefer speaking English?
Then deliver it to
Shall I tell him on the phone?
I don’t think this can help!
What I received is the Honeycomb Tripes.
The food in my order is the chicken feet.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain it.
Your deliveryman told me that the address could not be delivered.
It’s so horrible, and please cancel the order if I cannot receive it within 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, change an address?
Okay, then you don’t cancel the dialogue, and I will definitely follow it up if I am not refunded within 5 to 10 days.
Can I cancel the order if it is not delivered to me within 15 minutes?
The Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce should be cooked, but the dish that I received is raw and inedible.
I’ve waited for 3 days, but no replay has been made; I cannot join in the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because my credit card cannot be recognized by your system!
It’s really strange that I paid with the same credit card every time.
I have to pay for delivery fee every time now.
The monthly fee can be exempted before you complete the investigation, is that Okay?
Then how can I contact with the food deliveryman?
It’s almost three o’clock.
Then will I get compensation?
I noted to knock before giving me the delivery.
But that deliveryman just left it out of the door and left.
And with a wrong address.
Your deliveryman took my take-out in #NUMBER#, but I am told that it is in waiting now.
The deliveryman picked up my take-out at 19:25, but he didn’t start the delivery.
I’ll go and buy it, and do you need any other take-out food?
What shall I do?
Where is your deliveryman?
Do I still need to wait?
I placed a takt-out order.
Okay, then I’ll call the police since you refuse to cancel it.
But there may be safety and sanitation problems in my foods.
Please reimburse the discount code.
No problem, but don’t arrange for a re-delivery, because I have placed another order and I don’t like wasting food.
Thank you for your help.
I’ve reported about it with attached pictures, but I’ve received no reply, yet.
What beef, I didn’t order any beef.
It is the Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce, raw and inedible.
It’s inedible.
Are you sure these are foods cooked just now, but not cooked before?
unacceptable
I placed the order very early.
I was told that it would be de delivered a little over seven o’clock.
Why do you require it to be re-made?
It’s so ridiculous.
Hello,
I’ve just placed an order, showing that the food deliveryman is waiting in the restaurant, but the restaurant staff said the order is ready but the food deliveryman is not arriving there.
Could you help follow up, because I’m in a hurry, thank you.
It may be late for half an hour for no reason.
Have you actually solved the problem?
I’ve given it to my client, #PRS_ORG#  and cannot pull it to completed.
I have delivered it.
I won’t cancel it if it can be delivered to me within 20 minutes.
I want to cancel it, I’ve waited for so long.
You kept putting it off.
But the box of the Steamed Chicken with Chill Sauce is full of raw meat which is inedible, and can I apply for refunding?
Pineapple, tamagoyaki and steamed buns are not found in the box, #PRS_ORG# returned #NUMBER# yuan
Can I apply for refunding for the Steamed Chicken with Chill Sauce?
It is inedible raw meat.
Can I cancel it? Is it okay?
