To conclude, I personally think "Only Fools Rush In" is an all-round rotten film, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the movie is not a bright spot, it's not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of rotten films, so that you can sleep soundly in the cinema is one, so that you are angry after watching it is also one, "Only Fools Rush In" to the audience is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Keshi novel, indescribable, with many loopholes like a trench coat on ponies.
Even after watching it you'll wonder if there's a director's metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's actually a lump of shit.
Let's start by briefly saying some of the plot that I find difficult to understand.
The male owner should live on a small island in the south, and live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranges for a lord in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
The old man is riding a van from the south to the northeast to watch the snow??
He and his father were very reassured about it.
Then the old man did not follow.
How did a woman get her business license when she opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's flying car party gangster easily close a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
The feeling of the props is too obvious.
Why can a small bugger who can't get credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card at a hotel and then force an arrangement to sit outside the door of the room without finding the owner?
This kind of inexplicable plot permeates the whole film, and because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main thrust of the film, or that the film has no main thrust at all, which is an abominable stitch-up monster.
At the beginning of the film you will think he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, half of the time you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the survival of the young people in the town is not easy, after watching you do not know what you actually saw, followed by a deep doubt about yourself, why the New Year's go to the cinema to enjoy the stool.
For most people, they are actually familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie steps up to success.
If you want to make a love movie, you're honest about the feud between a small-town youth who loves to ride a motorcycle and a waitress and sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot must not appear to contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's character, whose new motorcycle has just been burned and is still able to sing), cannot open a brain hole that even Kennedy can't see.).
As for the actress who is not mentally retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5-year-old, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
And I can't imagine why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Such a film is arranged in the Spring Festival stall, is it to add a block to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to practice at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat, such "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits the top of the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not withstand, it is difficult for a master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is, tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, you know you don't want to buy expensive, get a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so that the beat is cheap, you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you have improved, then come to me to buy expensive, I earn twice.
Suggest to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand racket a little better, choose the principle, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not sell the price, the new shoot 500, 600 is good, the second-hand 200 yuan, with a thousand yuan to enjoy?
Very friendly to newbies, but after the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not go through the novice stage.

What's the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was a "quick look! Project managers can hit the gold medal of the Olympic project" article very hot, it was mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire fighting, backpacking, apologizing is not to mention.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily poignancy of project managers, which represents the incompetence of the current project management work.
And the personnel engaged in project management work, also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma at work.
Judging by the annual increase in the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600 thousand, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid licenses was about 300 thousand, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of global PMP® licenses.
The number of PMP holders has increased year by year over the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and that the rapidly changing work environment lets us know that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but the real project management work is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, rely solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, can not be landed in the work, project estimates are not allowed, the sensitivity of the control is poor, the project dragged on and on; members of the division of labor is not clear, the "old" in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management for more than 10 years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talent, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R & D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, with the "R & D Project Manager Training Camp" online course.
Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, combined with many real-life cases, tools and methods of research and development enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and to bring efficient operational results for enterprises.
There is no excuse, you can first see how other students commented on the course: this course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the China-China expert team (the former Huawei R&D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
In addition, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students translate the learning content into specific work after class.
It is claimed that the new mountain area super-run exhaust is the loudest!
The car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's successor-the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly MYR 2 million, a year's road tax of MYR 10 thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That counts the small series also do not know, the data say 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably is the small series of myvi only to 30km/h when they reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly illustrate the style of the Lamborghini.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, Google yourself, small make up a number of Google does not necessarily give the explanation!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, it is not comfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
1km oil money is around RM1 (owners do not care at all)
Practice the position of getting on and off, or it will be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you'll be deaf when you get off the bus. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, it will be very narrow in the ordinary parking space, and it is afraid to be knocked on when the car next door opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself said, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video's super run is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!

As NFTs rush out of the loop, a new concept has sprung up in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn a steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-building game based on blockchain technology that combines a variety of gameplay including NFTs, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, directly ahead of "King's Glory".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said it had more than 1 million daily active users.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to enjoying and earning financial benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
See a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, refers to the choice of investment target industries, first of all to choose industries with large growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose industries with good future growth, consider in the next 3-5 years after the industry growth to achieve the best state of the industry; finally, to choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Come on for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to sum up 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to do things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current field continues to deepen or extend the horizontal field (strategic thinking) ; on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking) ; on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
In its 12 years of existence, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American state of El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender, the first time bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, for the first time in eight years, the U.S. Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares' launch of a bitcoin ETF and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market, and another expansion in cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main actor.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Lin, on the same day through a bank transfer remittance of 20 million yuan as a deposit.
Lin in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signed, which states, "if the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the payment method, leading to the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 20 million yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is difficult to fancy the house, the deposit paid, the house is ready, on the "one foot at the door" to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which let Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the final failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed to be unable to negotiate, so the penalty of the deposit should not be applied in the case, and the defendant did not have to bear the responsibility for breach of contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
The lawyer cautioned that the necessary duty of care should be exercised in the course of the transaction.
When signing the contract, as the buyer to do the necessary duty of care, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and in the contract clearly about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is the second week of your move to Japan.
You were walking down the street, and suddenly you found someone following you, and you walked faster and faster in fear, and finally ran.
The man chased after you, "Miss, please wait!" (full Japanese conversation) You stopped at the convenience store door.
"Miss... I'm a director, I think you look beautiful, interested in participating in a reality show?"
You're puzzled and afraid it's a hoax.
He stuffed you with a business card, and you found out that he was really the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
"If you have the time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay will be there."
You came to the company with him in a muddle, and he said he saw you in the street at a glance, and very much wanted you to come.

Unintentionally see the following article, from a commercial point of view and the perspective of the shelf life of why the customer to the logistics company in the bonded area to help do the canned goods, although the canned goods are deep processing, not the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in the bag and listen to them are the same, there is no difference.
So you are sure to ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of hearing bags is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so large?
In fact, from this point a lot of consumers, or mom-level think that this is because the raw materials are not the same so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality to eat after the reaction also said that listen to the taste or taste is not the same!
Now let me say to you first listen to the reason that the installation is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why is the difference so large when they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers at the time of pricing take into account that if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits produced by manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit, then what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening devices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push is a listening device, rather than a bag.
And you think that so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, how does this cost?
You can imagine that.
So with the development of society, the marketing costs, such as: marketing personnel in shopping malls, display costs in shopping malls, product giveaways, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
So each manufacturer is also constantly increasing new products, and is listening to the assembly, its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs of new products.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of not more than 3, 4 yuan.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their products, regardless of means, linked to the hospital doctors, who assist in the promotion of the product, from a hearing inside the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate such methods, in fact, this practice is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy a bag of milk powder into a can on the premise of having a can at home, so that you can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, there is no impact on children.
There are also people do not think that the shelf life of the listening bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the listening bag and the bag is the same after the opening of the bag, just that the bag is not easy to save after the opening of the bag, easy to be affected by moisture deterioration.
I just saw an article that was written as a fake, which is too long.
Give science to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first official holiday on a day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, the premise of good health will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck can turn over (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people three days, some people a week; some people are few, and some people have blood slides; some people have no response, and some people have pain until the ambulance takes them away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and the previous pain does not mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation can not be controlled, start to end a few days to the end of the 24-hour bleeding, can do only with a sanitary towel or tampon blood to prevent the flow of clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly because of the secretion of prostaglandins, physiological period just before the beginning of the menstrual period to eat ibuprofen can be effective in alleviating the pain of the month, after the onset of dysmenorrhea to eat no use.
Before the physiological period because of uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, easy to loose stomach.
If it is about the cycle, somehow loose stomach, basically within two days will come menstruation.
Sanitary towels are best replaced two or three hours, or easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add a prepared portion may have 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modified here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation can also be because of hormonal changes in the body emotional instability, is very unfortunate, the body to make a trip to themselves.
But official crime rate data show that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they don't use emotional issues as an excuse.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding of the endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the endometrium thickens) ready to meet the guests, the guests do not come, all tear down (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, consecutive decades, a few days a month 24 hours of blood, but also abdominal pain and low back pain, who would like?
But a person can be born because his mother comes to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare for the first time you come to this world to live in a 10-month house, everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, a lot of women's things were suppressed, and society said it was dirty and shameful to brainwash women, and everyone thought it was that, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the female body's preparation for life is disgusting, should not be said in public, the girls stand up, do not think so again, have never experienced, this life will not experience, and do not know much about the men, do not be so ungrateful at any rate, this attitude how good to face their mother, how good to want their own children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which are really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study, through rational reasoning and logic, of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the way of the metaphysical person, and the device of the metaphysical person" in the I Ching and the Trilogy Upload, which was translated by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) from the metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extended problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent the real entity of existence, and which nouns simply represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
It is based on the belief that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the study of God without a word.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Theory of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the norms of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into metaethics (the study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism in the abstract), and normative ethics (the evaluation of different moral views, and the recommendation of moral guidelines for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should adhere to), applied ethics (the study of the application of ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the collection of information about how people live, summarizing it from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not begin with a preconceived theory, but rather investigates the true choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to that choice, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have received over the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
The vast majority of the old parents of the victims are now dead, and the orphans have grown up and started a family and employment.
It was your righteous act that helped us distressed families through the most difficult of times.
At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop making humanitarian contributions to the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is long overdue for a perfect end.
I will always remember your love, and I firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance between the National Federation of Learning (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the National Learning Federation and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often cross.

Relief money is often not delivered smoothly to June 4 difficult hands.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by "Tiananmen Mothers" to co-ordinate and be in charge of the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4 Orphan Education Fund", 11 years after its implementation, in 2009, after all of the June 4 orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then established the "June 4 Solitary Elderly Special Difficult Households Relief Fund", and has been implemented so far.
The funding for these projects comes mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June 4, from the generosity of individuals, and is supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Reform-through-Labour Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, for the first time in 31 years, that the June 4 disaster victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June 4.
During this period, China Human Rights has also been independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of the June 4 donation is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed all retirees, whose income is not as abundant as it was before retirement, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr. Ding's "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of those in difficulty to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those brave and courageous colleagues who have persisted in their generosity and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.
A little programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it will take six months to learn.
But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are extremely weak in self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the teacher strength of this institution, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong teacher strength.
Secondly, before choosing to explore the training institution, it is best to explore the students out of the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution in the end, the course taught is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your major, age, language you want to learn, or even which city you are in, it all depends on the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now a lot of online offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if I said these cases, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b station also has a lot of training resources, if you will not look for resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed advice is also OK.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the study does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also special questions to answer, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal push places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the post-job interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, because I do not know your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I, to undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, hood, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty seam, domestic service

2. Although the Rightists have an era of ambition in history, it is not long, so it is short because a little sun shines, and a little boiling water sweats; a little ambition leads to prosperity, and when attacked, it will be short-lived.
But to be realistic, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution's definition of truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li-dong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li-dong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory, I believe that anti-necessary revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood is damaged, political groups are mixed in the mud, and then foreign countries take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we need to be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to be emboldened by political speculation are not the right, they are assholes.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of anachronistic and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when it needs to, then the left is not created, because what the left wants is the dregs the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends fighting against thieves while contradicting their left foot, and still quite angry, so I don't think it is necessary.
Do not try to reason with a traitor or a left epilepsy, they are all a sinew, unreasonable to talk about.
And don't try to prove we're right, let alone let the anti-thief and the left-hander admit, why?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left-hander scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get older, they forget them, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually away, and even kill a dragon at the end of the year become a evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture lead to China as a whole should be left-leaning.
On the other hand, the domestic right is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and focuses more on equity and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, it's all right to like it
I don't say anything about it, but flowers are just that
Over the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the United States Emperor has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States imperialist crackdown on China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises at the same time to blockade China's chip industry, a direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing chip manufacturers to reduce investment in research and development, production capacity decline, resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chain disorder.
Now the "lack of core" has affected the world's major industries, such as car companies to stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all industries that use chips are suffering.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip", technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to go on the path of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves, and is hosting the "chip summit "; it is also inviting the 64-country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and draw funds to support the domestic technology giants of the United States, for example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant of the United States, spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and open up the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this certainty is that, as an old technology giant of the United States, Intel has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent and technical reserves, and will be able to rapidly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made an amazing speech, for Intel to spend money to build a wafer factory this move, Zhang Zhongmou has no scruple to say: Intel built a chip foundry, quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the field of wafers is because Zhang Zhongmou is still upset about a feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has been the pearl of the United States' manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world, and is the world's dominant semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been mastered by a small number of powerful.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, some small businesses are overwhelmed by this model, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only afford to stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Motivated by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation phenomenon, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there are companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there are companies specializing in design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", and does not carry out design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was a little help in front of the Big Mac, Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had looked for Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was very high, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also concluded that Intel was looking down on wafer processing services at the time.
Did not expect that the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then, but now also want to start doing wafer foundry.
So, Zhang Zhongmou thought it was ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry.
TSMC's market value now exceeds that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel is naturally not afraid to stand still.
Today, TSMC has made a sprint toward a 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, where it was seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Take a look at some "strange hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Random selection of three hot searches: February Erlong rise, Hollyoaks price increases, and goods Lara event, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the "index decline" (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion will have a small hump again.
They seem to be no different from the "evolving model of online public opinion" once displayed on the CAC's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six heat searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "solitary peaks", "jagged", and "cliff-like".
"Solitary peak" that is artificial heating, quickly hit the list of hot search, causing public concern; "jagged" that is periodic heating, to ensure that the topic of hot search list; "cliff-like" that is collective withdrawal, the hot search play a "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another, and the time is not different, so it must be the unified water forces that have been tasked to start a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which blackmail decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes to refine the battle, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread and spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, put aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.
Data source: hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the title of the traditional TV should refer to LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning of the difference, there are the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the full spread of LCD TV market positioning, laser TV is clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meet the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to China Yikang's forecast, in 2020, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high growth.
The reason for having such a good result in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eye, compared to the back light source of LCD TV light, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Saisi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, came to 144 sets of test data.
Data confirmed: laser TV does have a strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast with LCD TV prices continue to decline, the current market price of laser TV is mostly in the tens of thousands of yuan, with the size and light source upgrade, the price gradually climbed.
Why does laser TV sell so expensive?
It must have made sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TV has a lot of advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is small, and the host is small, take up a small space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and so on, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
There is no pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players, want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try, everything has pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment, afraid of listening to one-sided words.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV-has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structure Fresnel screen, expensive, 80-inch price can basically be replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection for the eyes good as a selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, must be real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it can not be like.
It's just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a lot of light is reflected into the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, reliable?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the establishment conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Regulation of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015) " tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan before it can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are in fact very demanding, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervision of insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders should have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are three thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, a lot of companies star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest hit and Thai Super Mary 5 serious illness insurance, claims and insurers are and Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: the products of the Internet platform, because there is less operating costs of business outlets, and the cost of salesman wages, so the Internet products generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of the policyholder, at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professional requirements of the industry, a lot of Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of errors, in the health information and occupation of this, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their subjective awareness, feel their health or in line with, so there are a lot of claims hidden dangers, there may be a risk of rejection.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform, like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true, but also reliable, not reliable is the people, the Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are a lot of sales misinformation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance to cover 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 6 million serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the heavy lifting, will not tell the policyholder, 1 yuan in the first month, the next month is required to be charged according to the normal, dozens to 200, many customers deduct a fee for a year or two to buy their own is not clear.
Thinking it could cost one dollar, the insurance company paid six million (the world's pie).
Free mobile phone, is the end of the policy number such as 6666, 8888 this special policy number paragraph only to send, and if the winning text message is issued, they do not exchange, and no one reminds.
(This is another pit for the policyholder) Free 60000 serious illness insurance, is a short-term, if you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60000 can do it, can not solve the problem, later life begins to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misinformation about Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, the problem is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesman.
Suggested topic master comprehensive careful consideration, in fact, a lot of offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are also better than the cost-effective Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and saving 2,000-3,000 yuan/year in premiums per person.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, has three years of enterprise management training experience, has served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from customer needs, customized insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers to shop around, try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy sorting, policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Life-long growth with each customer.
I hope that my answer can be helpful to the question owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance adviser need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder himself.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony", or even the printed version of the paper contract is not, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, a bit like "telemarketing" general assembly line operations, but so buying insurance can also have a fatal problem, and that is, follow, up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we have chosen is an "insurance intermediary" who can stay with us for a long time and will provide us with services many years from now?
From the past to the present, I am opposed to all forms of slander and abuse, and even less can I accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we want to put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, to making teasing posts, to your attempts to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive approach.
You later intensified your efforts not only to tag me on the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to brazenly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some vague, humiliating comments about me, look, body, how to have a baby, what kind of bed to grow strawberries, whether to plug, and so on, and I, too.
Then I got a number of friends who sent me a picture of you and sexual harassment comments about your Facebook friend account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer continue to be silent.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, no matter what status you are, in our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make this kind of teasing, vague, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your picture or you can continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yeah, I can't, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would be willing to be so humiliated in order to be famous.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's OK after being so bullied.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in business, only those who do not even have basic moral qualities will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in people's hearts.
I cut some of the messages for you to comment on
No one can pretend to be you if you post it yourself
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization
A smile on your face
2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese Communist Party media multi-dimensional report: The latest news of China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is visiting Guam in a rare way, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, the satellite spotted the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with an F-35C fighter jet and a CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising the Pacific Ocean.
The Lincoln also carried for the first time an F-35C carrier aircraft squadron, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Perception) The U.S. three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China in a rare visit to Guam, January 17, 2022, on the flight path of the U.S. carrier transport CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Perception) Also, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend, CNN reported on January 17.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base Guam on Saturday (January 15).
A rare visit to Guam by the U.S. three aircraft carriers amassing the most powerful weapons in China's neighborhood said it was a signal to allies and enemies amid growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a United States ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrates U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on U.S. soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose income mainly comes from advertising, and the advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many Apps external Meta ads, through Meta's advertising platform is realized.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy changes, Meta can no longer get user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow Apps to access their own information, which most people's normal reaction is certainly not.
If Google stabs again next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous income growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
You usually know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that do business in the sea.
Meta has an office in Hong Kong of about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unbeatable advertising channel, and most of the money burned goes to Meta.
Interestingly, now ByteDance's TikTok is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years Meta has made a lot of money from bytes.
Various domestic agents are helping ByteDance go to Meta to advertise there, and Meta Greater China's performance is also very good.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TikTok, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just falling incomes, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not just at income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metaverse implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a tough time for Meta.
Despite the fact that Facebook is very popular right now, with $100 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue, in fact, Facebook is very dangerous right now, and there is no good safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although several of his social software is now relatively high daily life, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook does not have much confidence, subversion is a blink of an eye.
And the elusive concept of the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a no-return road above is some of my thinking, for reference.
