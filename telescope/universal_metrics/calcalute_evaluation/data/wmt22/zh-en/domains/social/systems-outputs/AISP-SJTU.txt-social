First of all, I personally think "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spots, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and the other that makes you indignant after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, which is indescribable and flawed like a trench coat on Mark.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The man's residence should be on an island in the south, living alone with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a big uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minibus.
Old people watch snow from south to northeast in vans? ?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man has no following.
How did the hostess get the business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can wild one punks on the island easily close a mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This sense of props is too obvious.
Why did wild one, a punk who failed to collect credit and was suspected of breaking the law, become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specially asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but he doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot fills the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, that is, an abominable sewing monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a feature film that wants to show that it is difficult for young people in small towns to survive. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit in the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeds step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, you should honestly talk about the feud between the young people who like to ride motorcycles and the waiter's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Andrew's new motorcycle has just been burned, and then he can sing), so he can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't stand watching.
As for the hostess who is obviously not retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Another point I don't understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own movies.
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice my hands first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish it, the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry beat" is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very big, the hard ball can't hold it, and it is difficult for the master to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is-tennis is so difficult, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you are not willing to buy expensive ones and make a bargain to fool you. If you play twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. When the time comes, come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, and choose prince or Deng Lupu's. These two brands are not famous enough, so good racquets can't be sold at a price. It's good to shoot 500 or 600 new racquets. If you buy 200 second-hand racquets, don't you enjoy a thousand yuan?
It's friendly to novices, but it's chicken ribs after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Events where Project Managers Can Impact Gold Medals" is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, traveling on business and staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, not to mention putting out fires, carrying back pots and apologizing.
An article that seems to be a joke and ridicule also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project.
And people who are engaged in project management gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in their work through some actions.
According to the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professionals) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China for 20 Years (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP ® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP ® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificates was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
In recent 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the past "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we should learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that they can systematically master the ten fields and five process groups of project management by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and I don't know how to practice it; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delayed project; The division of labor among members is unclear, and the "old slicker" in the team does not know how to deal with the unsmooth communication of cross-departmental assistance, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years and has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "Training Demonstration Base for R&D Management Talents of Chinese Enterprises", has come with the online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
The online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
There is no evidence to say, so we can first see how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only made by Zhongtian Huaxia Expert Team (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises to explain the course content in a simple and professional way.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform their learning contents into specific work after class.
It is claimed that the exhaust sound of super running in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This car brought by our team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year. It is four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know if I count Xiaobian. According to the data, it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably when Xiaobian's myvi reaches 30km/h, people will reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissors doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
I don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it myself, and editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention has been paid, and everyone is watching wherever they go, which is very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's a little cool.)
The gas cost of 1km is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, or it will be a little awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the bus. (But it's still cool.)
The car body is too big, parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run of this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot videos for your car, please contact us!

When it comes to a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that riders know that Chiron is one of the most expensive superraces in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and millions of super-runners Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the results, expensive is reasonable!
When NFT rushed out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game named "Axie Infinity" had a great impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of games including NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest transaction volume at present, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars up to now.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to the glory of the king.
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role, and can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of investment target industries. First of all, we must choose industries with large growth space and at least 100 billion market size; Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market size, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Come on for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the tactical layout of 2021 and 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", that is, to do things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and there is room for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new ones; On top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin legal tender, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, which marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from the housing agency. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the owner of the house, about the details of purchasing the factory building, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt of Deposit for Factory Sales", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled. Return to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, which led to the delay in signing the housing sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
I finally took a fancy to the house, and the deposit was paid and the house price was ready, so I just signed the contract, but the seller didn't sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract could not only be attributed to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty of deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract by doubling the return of deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] We should fulfill the necessary duty of care in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied or not, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is the second week you moved to Japan.
You walk down the street and suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear, and finally you run.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait!" You stop in front of the convenience store.
"Miss... I am a director. I think you are beautiful. Are you interested in participating in the reality show?"
You are confused and afraid that this is a hoax.
He gives you a business card, and you find that he is really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If Miss has time, we can go to the company to talk, and the pay must be indispensable."
You came to the company with him in a confused way. He said that he saw you in the street at a glance and very much hoped that you could come.
You signed the contract thinking there was nothing to lose and you could make money.
This is a large-scale love reality show, which is divided into two parts.
In the early stage, stars and amateurs will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.
Later, they will enter the game to break through together.
The official recording will begin next week. You don't know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, talking about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help make canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company. Here, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged milk powder are exactly the same as those of canned milk powder, and there is no difference.
Then people will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged bags one year, while the shelf life of tinned bags two years or longer?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between tin and bag so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive ones are good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of canned clothes is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why cans are expensive and where are they expensive?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profits generated by manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit, so what can manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a great increase in the pricing of tinned clothes to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push cans instead of bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers have to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as the promotional staff of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are tinned, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by hook or by crook, linked with doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
However, China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is suggested that you buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs, increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned bags is longer than that of bagged bags. If the shelf life of canned bags is the same as that of bagged bags after opening bags, it just means that bagged bags are not easy to preserve and easy to be affected with damp and deteriorate.
I just read an article about my period. It's too long.
Give popular science to men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea will occur around the age of 50.
After that, it will come regularly once a month on the premise of good health.
However, it is not regular enough to accurately predict. The tolerance of about one week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes it will overturn if it is unlucky (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some for three days and some for one week; Some people flow less, and some people collapse; Some people don't respond, some people are in pain until they are transported away by ambulance, and dysmenorrhea will change with time. No pain before doesn't mean no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding occurs 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen quickly before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of physiological period can effectively relieve the pain in the current month. It is useless to eat again after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before physiological period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you probably arrive at the cycle, you will have diarrhea inexplicably, and you will have menstruation within two days.
Sanitary napkins should be replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 tablets. If you add the portions prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify here. You don't need to change tampons frequently. You can change tampons every five or six hours, and the longest is eight hours.)
Menstrual hormones may be irritable, and ovulation will be unstable because of hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will stumble on itself.
But official crime figures show that women still have a high level of emotional control, and they don't use emotional problems as excuses.
It's not just blood, it includes the shed endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome the guests. If the guests do not come, all of them will be torn down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, which goes on and on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades in a row, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who is willing?
But a person can be born because his mother has had menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels sick from menstruation, I feel disgusted by the preparation of women's bodies for giving birth to life, It shouldn't be said in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude face their mother and want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They are really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the way, and the metaphysical is called the device" in the Book of Changes, which was translated by Metaphysic by Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
Metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, which was put forward by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of not saying a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a philosophical branch that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and studies human moral life. Here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various moral values and giving moral guidelines and suggestions for correct or wrong behaviors.
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made by the actual moral agent and observed, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice. It studies the ethics held by social groups.
Ethical history includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: Ethical thoughts of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of politics, Represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empiricist ethics, Representative: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, Representative: Spinoza and others, In the 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, Representative: Voltaire and others, In the 18th and 19th centuries, German academic ethics, Representative: Kant and Hegel, In the 18th and 19th centuries, British utilitarian ethics, Representative: Bentham and Sikivik, In the 19th century, English evolutionary ethics, Representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., German neo-Kantian ethics in the late 19th century, Li Kaier, etc., neo-Hegelian ethics in the late 19th century, Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrational ethics, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of studying the essence and significance of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance in the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally sent an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and started families and worked.
It was your righteous deeds that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
At present, COVID-19 pandemic is raging all over the world, and most donors have retired at the age of.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating money to our mother group in Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by IFCSS and Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National Association for Learning and Self-help and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often cross.

Relief money often cannot be delivered smoothly to June 4th.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, "Mother Tiananmen Square" set up a special team to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphan Relief Fund", which has been implemented ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by campus and social donations in June 4th, generous donations from individuals and supported by the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of June 4 finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4.
During this period, "Human Rights in China" also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped donating on June 4th for the sake of donors. We are all retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect our decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and courageous colleagues who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid money for many years.
A programming white who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to study.
However, if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose self-study, but you will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, the teachers of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing, and it is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of this institution know what this institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a great relationship with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all these will be related to the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and you haven't graduated yet, Or a computer major has graduated, so if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Nowadays, many offline training institutions are actually very good, but the first learning cost is high, and the second investment time is more, which basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources when going to bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that it is not very laborious to study, the teacher explains it in detail, and some people answer questions specially. In addition, it is also helpful in study planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend to go to the company after studying, so that a lot of things can be saved in the interview process of finding a job later.
These are some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only introduce it in detail. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boiler water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, installation of lamps, cleaning glass, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently praise me, work hard for life, life is tired, but I have to continue
Life will live up to everyone who works hard. Pay attention to me if you like it. Thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, and they support the process alone. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong, that is, to continue. The road can look back but can't go back...
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Cleaning Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and the effort will eventually pay off!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart and keep beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui Home Economics has helped you to "clean" what I can and serve your family.
Keep thousands of families clean, build housekeeping monuments, provide services in place, and get home clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it overflow and shine, so is life
Only by doing it with your heart can you succeed, and we are serious about shaping exquisiteness and beauty sewing.
Give me a chance, you will be satisfied, quality shows everything, because the professional is worthy of trust, your recognition is my most encouraging!
Nowadays, all walks of life are hard to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The plan of a day lies in the morning, and all the good things begin in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and happiness, and keep a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness is a thing, and having it is happiness; When you grow up, happiness is a goal, and you will be happy when you reach it; After maturity, it is found that happiness is a state of mind, and happiness is realized.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, take your own road; Two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful and never too old!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different problems.
Most of the time, it is not your ability that binds you, but your courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problems will be solved easily.
Second, although the Rightists have achieved success in history, they are not long, so they are short because they are brilliant when they give some sunshine and sweat when they drink some boiled water; If you are a little successful, you will be able to look at Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the Rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing economy, improving science and technology, promoting administrative institutionalization and safeguarding human rights, the positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I think that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to take advantage of the fire by political speculation are not Rightists, but assholes.
Let's talk about left again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left will not have this nature, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting left epilepsy while fighting against thieves, and they were quite angry. I don't think it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all the same tendons and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left epilepsy scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even slaughtered the dragon and became an evil dragon at the end of the year.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. The innate genes of history and culture in China lead to the left of China as a whole.
In China, the right is free and pays attention to efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will struggle to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although you can't understand it, you will be finished if you like it
Don't say anything, Huahua is so brave
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists not only caused Huawei to fall into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The US imperialists suppressed China's chip industry, Requiring their own enterprises and related enterprises in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing the disorder of chip supply chain shortage worldwide.
Nowadays, "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production of car companies and the price increase of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries began to take the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, Laomei has recently acted frequently and presided over the "Chip Summit"; It also invited 64 giants to set up semiconductor alliances, and allocated funds to support American local technology giants. For example, Intel, an old technology giant of the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves, which is bound to rise rapidly in a short time and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made amazing remarks. Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's investment in building a fab: It is quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still resents a feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of American manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world and being the overlord in the world semiconductor field.
By 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode, and chips were designed, manufactured, sealed and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged from facing huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims at the single link of "wafer processing" in its main business, and only provides OEM services for wafer manufacturing without design.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was wannabe in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once looked for Intel Capital, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of chip industry, it obviously thought highly of itself, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also decided that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I didn't expect the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in those days to start wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou found it ironic that Intel entered wafer foundry.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still stays at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Let's look at some "strange hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of dragons on February 2nd, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Lalamove incident. The spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the "exponential decline" (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will reappear.
They look no different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed by official website, the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "isolated peak", "serrated" and "cliff-like".
"Lonely peak" means artificial heating, which quickly rushes to the hot search and attracts public attention; "Sawtooth" means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; "Cliff-like" means collective evacuation. The hot search has played its "function", received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of water troops received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: Dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, and which entangle decision-making. Black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks by will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser tv and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the title should refer to LCD TV, and the differences between laser tv and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser tv focuses more on the big screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser tv obviously focuses more on the big screen market, or laser tv itself is a product for the big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser tv is generally over 75 inches, and the largest one is over 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, laser tv's global shipments and sales have been increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of laser tv market will increase by more than 140%, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why laser tv has achieved such good results in the big screen market is mainly attributed to its outstanding performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection in laser tv, the light emitted by laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to eyes is less.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative test of watching laser tv and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data prove that laser tv does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
With more and more attention paid to vision health, laser tv not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser tv focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the declining price of LCD TV, the current price of laser tv is mostly over 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser tv so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser tv has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can't achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser tv is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can realize the 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, which requires little space, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser tv can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the equipment loss is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV sets are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
There is no false demand, but the product of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser tv is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself, and you are afraid to listen to one side of the story.
To put it simply, laser tv, a super wide-angle near-focus projector, has to use expensive super wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the curtain, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the Fresnel curtain with microstructure is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by 65 inches of liquid crystal.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers' selling point that diffuse reflection is good for eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that eyes can see is direct light for eyes. If you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. It must be true that LCD TV is also diffuse "direct". Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, it can't be image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain curtain is just ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before they can be established, which must be approved by the CIRC.
These three articles are actually very harsh, To sum up, we must have strength, It must be approved by the national authority department of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks in the whole country), and shareholders should have a good style. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured need not question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be achieved by any insurance company.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment, reduces the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can incite the leverage of insurance to the maximum extent.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: This is particularly important, Because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insuring, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it, which is prone to many hidden dangers of claims settlement and may be refused compensation.
I have done insurance telephone sales in Tencent Micro Insurance (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is true and reliable. People are unreliable. There are no professional employees in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, 1 yuan has insurance coverage of 6 million yuan, buys insurance to send mobile phones, and receives 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important points and will not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. It is unclear what many customers bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company lost 6 million yuan.
Free mobile phone delivery is only delivered by special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not exchange it and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) It is short-term to get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and your life will start streaking in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, on the whole, there is no problem with the platform and products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should consider it carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, and each person saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, With 3 years of enterprise management training experience, I have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers according to their needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting and policy custody for customers, so that customers can feel at ease.
Grow up with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all the steps can be completed by the insured independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a sense of "ceremony", and may not even have a printed paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This mode is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem when buying insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
From before to now, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just want to put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that we must resist first.
Since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting teasing posts, and then trying to post the so-called home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, figure, good fertility, what kind of strawberries are planted in bed, and whether to insert such messages, I... Forget it.
How do you know? Later, I received many friends' comments about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments on your Facebook friend account?
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are. In our society, we need respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, How are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say that she is fine after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some messages for everyone to comment on
No one can pretend to be you if you post it yourself
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
A knowing smile
The US three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China. Rare visits to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional reports: The latest news on Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; The US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to American allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier was discovered by satellite near Barabak Strait.
Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform predicts that the Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
The US aircraft carriers cruising in the Pacific Ocean now include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, in addition to the Carl Vinson.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, is currently deployed by the US Navy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Lake Champlain" guided missile cruiser and the "Stockdahl" guided missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN) 1 on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The US three aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China, and made a rare visit to Guam. According to the analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time that a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since 1980s.
US three aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China, rarely visit Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness and continuous commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of 14 "Thunder Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make Thunder Submarines "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located in the United States and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of US $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function orientation, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected with Meta advertisements, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, which will clearly prompt users whether to allow App to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has also weakened before (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies with marine business.
Meta has several hundred offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel for Chinese companies to expand overseas markets, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT of bytes is one of Meta's main competitors now, but Meta can make a lot of money from bytes in the past two years.
Every agent in China is helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
Recently, I didn't know it specifically, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, it is expected to look at the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told "metaverse".
Metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social softwares have a relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social softwares, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is just a blink of an eye.
And engaging in the unattainable concept of metaverse, There is no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, and it is a road of no return. Above are some of my thoughts for reference.
