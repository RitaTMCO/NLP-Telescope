To conclude, I personally think the Four Seas is a full-length shit, in all respects.
But if you say that this film is not a highlight, it is not at least a good choice.
A lot of kinds of shit, you can fall asleep in the movie theater is one, you can see the aftermath of anger is also one, the Four Seas for the audience is like a monkey on the ears, it can in countless ways to light up your anger.
In this point of insulting the audience, Korean is truly talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature in the novel, difficult to name, and there are many flaws like the shirt on the body of the little Mago.
Even after viewing it, you’ll doubt if there’s a metaphor of the director’s implication, but when you think about it carefully, you find it’s actually shit.
First, let me explain a few things that I find difficult to understand.
The man's home should be on a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the story arranged a gentleman in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old man sitting in the car from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very reassured.
The old man is not below.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned boat, how did the owner get a business license?
Why can the island's flying car party small mess easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent the steel pipe in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, not even the truck driver could be found.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small blunder car party suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary policeman?
In the face of Goliath loan, why not call the police, the police in the movie also asked specifically whether there were difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door in a hotel with a room card, then forcefully arrange not to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep?
This bizarre plot is filled with the whole film, and it’s so unspectical that it hurts me when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main purpose of the film, or that the film has no subject at all, is a look disgusting seamless.
At the beginning of the film you will think he wants to shoot a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an incentive film, half of the time you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the survival of small town youth, after watching you do not know exactly what you watched, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why over the years to run to the cinema to admire sputum.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with all kinds of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then encourage + comedy and tell the audience how a talented cookbird is step by step towards success.
If you want to make a love film, then you can honestly talk about the conflict between the youth of a small town who loves motorcycling and the maid of the waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can’t show up something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle Yin was just burned, and then can still sing the role), you can't go open some brains that even Kennedy could not endure.
As for whether the actress is obviously not a weak mind that can act in some ways like a five-year-old child, I really don’t know whether this is the reason for acting or the director’s requirement.
Another thing I also really wonder why Korean as a racing driver is so keen to add a crash story in his own movie?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival archives to get the audience stuck?
Thanks to the support of today, 80 boxes have all been sent out!

Want to try tennis, but also afraid of not being able to persist, so want to find an approximate price practitioner.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship, if it is not possible to distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap shot, such a "introduction shot" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the kick, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not stand, and the best man is difficult to control.
The logic and subtitle of their existence is - - tennis is so difficult, knowing that you will not learn, and also knowing that you will not be afraid to buy expensive, get a cheap stuff to mess with you, you will play twice, you will not play again, so this kick is cheap, you will not be hurt.
As soon as you can really distinguish between good and bad, showing that you have progressed, at the time to come back to me here to buy expensive, I earn twice the money.
Proposal to spend the same price, buy a second hand better shot, choose Prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good shot can not sell the price, new shot 500, 600 is good, second hand 200, have a thousand dollar shot enjoyment is not?
It is very friendly to newcomers, but after the newcomer phase is over, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer phase.

What’s the biggest fire in 2021?
The Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only the Olympics can win the prize?
The previous period of time there was an article "Have a look! project manager can hit gold medal Olympic project" article is very fiery, in which the project managers in many projects, absolutely can be a horse in advance, no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying overnight is the project manager's daily, fire rescue, bacon, apology is not in the words.
A seemingly joking article, but also outlines the daily bitterness of project managers, behind which is the lack of attention to the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work, also gradually choose to get rid of the difficulty in the work through some actions.
From the year-on-year rise in PMP (International Accredited Project Management Professional Qualification) enrollment, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the national cumulative PMP® application number was 600,000, the PMP® certification number was approximately 420,000, and the effective holding number was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® holding total.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificates has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply taking pictures of past "old experiences", and the rapidly changing working environment let us know one to learn, stand on the shoulders of science giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP ensure that project management works smoothly?
Many project management beginners say that by studying related courses such as PMP / IPMP, you can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and five major process groups, but when you really do project management work, it is still a fog.
Many project managers often feedback on the following questions: project management awareness is not in place, simply relying on personal experience, empty project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of system of project management process system support, work cannot land, project forecast is not permitted, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed and delayed; members' division of work is not clear, the "old oil line" in the team does not know how to respond to cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management in the field of more than ten loads, has helped numerous excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key research and development talents, and obtained the honorary title of "Chinese enterprises R & D and management talents training demonstration base" and other "R&D project manager special training camp" online course.
This is an online method of fragmented learning, combining practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D-based enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to facilitate the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
Speaking without blame, you can first see how other participants evaluate this course: this course is not only made by a team of experts (Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and many well-known companies' real business scenarios, to give an in-depth and professional interpretation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students convert the content they learn to specific work after class.
It is said that the new mountains are the most exhausted!
This car that our team brought for everyone is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar, Murcielago’s alternate model – Aventador LP700-4!
The price of almost two million marks, a year of road tax marks tens of thousands, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horses, how fast can you imagine?
The data says that 0-100km / h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably the myvi of the small group is only 30km / h when people reach 100km / h, well.
The low body of the car, the upscale cutting doors, the huge outlet around the car and the glass-shaped 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, Google itself is enough, the short article has some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too much attention, everywhere everyone is looking, very unselfish!
1km oil costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Exercise the posture of getting out of the car, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not get out of the cab and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud and you will be deaf when you get off the car.
The car body is too large, it will be narrow in the ordinary parking space, and I am afraid to be knocked by the next door when the car opens!
A bit of loneliness, because there is no opponent on the road (the small talk itself, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don’t get mistaken, this video isn’t for sale!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your love car, welcome to contact us!
More information you didn’t know about the car, at The Car Guide / People’s Car Journal
A car accident worth millions.
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are confident that all car friends know that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also a million!
Before that, overseas crashed millions of sports cars 911 in just a few minutes, and tens of millions surpassed Chiron!
Look at the result, it is expensive!
As the NFT burst out, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic starting to earn a stable income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-making game that brings together a variety of games, including NFT, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with more than $3 billion to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million per day, reaching King's Glory.
On August 6, Axie Infinity announced that it has more than 1 million live users.
The fire of Axie Infinity brings a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of the industry targeted for investment, first to choose a large industry, at least 100 billion in the market size; second, to choose a good industry for future growth, consider the industry growth to reach the best state in the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Go for the right course!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is “do the things right”, that is, do the things right.
The strategy is “do the right thing”, that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, and above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about the continuous deepening of the current field or horizontal field extension (strategic thinking); for example, on how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on how to improve the participation of activities (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to the right activity goals, such as enhancing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, accurate pulling; on the increase of DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has encountered several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small country of Central America, El Salvador, established Bitcoin as the legal currency, which is the first time Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, once again expanding the cryptocurrency investment space.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned from the home intermediary of a factory located in Zhejiang Yue Yao Tong Township, and after several visits to the house, Mr. Liu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the factory, and made a deposit of 200,000 yuan on the same day through a bank transfer.
Lin Mou signed on the factory purchase and sale settlement bill as the recipient, which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit is to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell this factory, the settlement will be returned to the seller twice, the two sides agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, afterwards, the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which resulted in the late conclusion of the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu.
It was not easy to see the house, the settlement was made, the house money was also ready, and the contract was signed "by the door and by the foot", but the seller did not sell it, which left Mr. Land helpless and angry.
For this purpose, Mr. Liu will prosecute Lin Mou to the Yuan City People's Court.
After the trial, the court concluded that the two sides ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract and could not be blamed only on the defendant, should be reasonably presumed that the consultation failed, so the case should not apply the penalty, the defendant does not have to bear the liability for the default of the double refund of the deposit.
After the judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second-instance courtined the original judgment.
The lawyer reminds us that the necessary caution must be taken during the transaction process.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer shall fulfill the obligation of due diligence, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and to specify in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to avoid the simultaneous performance of disputes between the two parties.
Your name is Zheng, this is your second week of moving to Japan.
You walk on the street and suddenly find someone following you, you feared to go faster and faster, and eventually ran up.
The man was following you: “Miss, please wait!” (Japanese conversation) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
“Miss... I’m a director, I think you look beautiful and are interested in a real-life show?”
You are suspicious, afraid it is a scam.
He puts you a visit card and you find that he is really the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
“Miss, if you have time, we can talk to the company, and the salary will not be less.”
You came to the company with him, and he said he saw you on the street, hoping that you could attend.
If you don’t think about losing anything and still make money, you have signed a contract.
This is a big real-life love show, divided into two parts.
The pre-period will let the stars and amateur live together in real life, cultivating tactics.

Inadvertently see the following article, from the point of view of the business and the period of storage, why this customer to the logistics company in the tax zone to help the container, although the container belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of the tax logistics company, here as follows this text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bag and the milk powder their raw materials are the same, there is no difference.
Then everyone will ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, and the shelf life of clothes is two years or more?
Why is the price difference between clothes and suitcases so high?
In fact, from this point, many consumers, or mom class think that because the raw materials are different so the quality will be a lot better.
In fact, just like raw materials, everyone thinks that what is expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating because of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of clothes is different!
Now let me tell you why it is expensive, where is it?
Why are the prices of the raw materials so different?
Because most manufacturers when pricing consider that if the price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, this means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a large increase in the price of clothing to secure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for listening clothes, not bags.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of billions of dollars each year on advertising, what does this cost?
Everyone can think.
Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as the promotion staff of the shopping mall, the exhibition costs of the shopping mall, the gift costs of products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So the various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it is clothing, its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials increase will not exceed three or four dollars.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked to the hospital's doctors, by which they assist in the promotion of products, from the first listening to the profit of 30 to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is damaging consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder packed with bags in the container in the house, so that you can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on young children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the suitcase is longer than the bag, if the suitcase and the bag shelf life is the same after the packaging is opened, only to say that the bag is not easy to store after the packaging is opened, and is susceptible to deformation.
I just read an old article, too long.
Give an unknown man.
Most girls suddenly experience their first vacation one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and close their periods around the age of 50.
Then, under the condition of health, it will be more regularly once a month.
But it is not the rule to be able to accurately predict, approximately a week of public transportation, need to be prepared in advance, sometimes the bad luck will turn ( suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some people three days, some people a week; some people flow less, some people collapse; some people have no reaction, some people hurt to the ambulance to go, the pain with time will change, before no pain does not represent a lifetime no pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, starting within a few days until the end of 24 hours of bleeding, can only be done with a toilet towel or sanitary cotton pad to prevent the flow of blood to the chair.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate adrenaline, the physiological period at the beginning has not yet reached the pain of the period, and it can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and after the start of the pain there is nothing to eat.
Pre-physiological period due to uterine blood filling and excessive release of prostate, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is likely to come to the cycle, the stomach will basically come in two days.
It is best to replace the towel for two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to reproduce bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if the pre-prepared portion can be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Change here, sanitary cotton sheets do not need to change often, about five or six hours can be changed once, for a maximum of eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more agitated, and the ovulation period will also be unstable because of the hormone changes in the body, which is very unfortunate, the body makes a trap for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control emotions and do not use emotional issues to find excuses.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the falling endometrium.
The endometrium after the end of the menstrual period is the thinnest, then slowly thickened, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (endometrium thickened) ready to welcome guests, the guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) the next month to build a new house, and began again.
Menstruation is very uncomfortable, decades in a row, a few days a month, 24 hours of bleeding, even belly pain, who would?
But a person can be born because his mother came through menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you to live in the house for 10 months when you first came to this world, everyone should thank their mother for the regular health of menstruation.
A lot of women's things were pressured before, society told women that brainwashing was dirty and shameful, everyone thought it was so, but the times changed.
If someone feels menstrual nausea, feels that the body of women for the preparation of the birth of life is nauseous, should not say it in the public, the girls stand up, don't think so, never experienced, this life will not experience, nor how to understand the men, don't so forgive the responsibility, no matter how, this attitude is how nice to face their mother, how good to want their own children?
Finally, sisters try the sanitary cotton, it really helps.
Methodology refers to the study of problems through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be directly answered through perception.

To a friend.
I sincerely thank my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the deaths of our loved ones, especially for the uninterrupted assistance that has been provided since I personally called for humanitarian assistance to my friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' elderly parents have died, and the orphans have grown into family employment.
It is your actions that help us, these families who have suffered through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the new coronavirus epidemic is erupting worldwide, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I urge you to stop the humanitarian donations to our hard-earned, the Mother of Tiananmen group, which should have long been the perfect phrase for this humanitarian rescue campaign.
I will forever remember your love, and I am convinced that your righteous conduct will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National American Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executives of the projects often cross.

Rescue funds are often not delivered smoothly to six-four difficult hands.
In 1994, the teacher suggested the establishment of a special group of "Mother of Tiananmen" to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Six Four Orphan Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years, and in 2009, after graduating from all Six Four Orphan Universities, the MCDF established the Six Four Orphan Special Emergency Fund, which has been implemented to date.
The funding for these projects, mainly from campus and community donations during the sixth quarter, comes from generous individual donations and is supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Six-Four members finally received a donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Six-Four.
During this time, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief programs.
We understand that Ding teacher calls for the six-fourth donation, is for the donor consideration, we are also indeed some retired elderly, the income is not as sufficient before retirement, especially to Ding teacher's "to friends" a letter of thanks.
We will respect the decision of the hard guys to end the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those courageous colleagues who have persisted in generosity for years and risked delivering humanitarian aid.
A small program that wants to share personal experiences.
If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you do not have this idea, it is best to study yourself, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it will take 6 months to study.
But if you intend to get into the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good option, especially for those with self-control and their weaknesses, training is a very good option.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose self-study, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will have no sense, of course, some new training institutions teaching strength is not strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to investigate the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know exactly what this institution is, the explanation of the course is good or bad.
Hi, in fact, I do not know how to answer this question, because there is no specific introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing and the individual situation has a great relationship.
For example, the profession, the age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all depends on the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from computer science, then if the time is enough I personally recommend self-study, this is the most efficient and cost-effective, now many offline training institutions are actually good, but the cost of study is high, the second investment time is more, basically need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I'm talking about these situations, self-learning is convenient, now many learning resources on the web are free, or go to station b there are a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or detailed advice too.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but also can pay for a certain amount of study money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that you do not have to work hard, the teacher explains it in detail, there are questions and special answers, and also helps in the planning or supervision of learning.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, promote the position, recommend to the company after studying, so that the job search interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions, because I do not understand your situation, so only the introduction is not detailed, if you have other things to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
Personally, undertaking various (installation, cleaning, repair), wall hanging oven water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, oil smoking machine, mounting lamps, rubber glass, professional seams, household services
Thank you to those who quietly praise me, fight hard for life, life is tired but to continue.
Life will not disregard every effort, please pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only see the outcome, self-support the process, face life, we are not strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the way can look back but can not go back and forth.
Cleaning is work and duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
We do the dirtyest work, but we will take the most serious attitude to clean up every corner of the customer, see the customer's satisfied smile and the thumb, that moment all the fatigue is worth it, paying the final reward!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Carefully serve, carefully clean, and keep it beautiful.
You care about the details, Feng Shui household help you to do the "clean" I can, serving the family.
Keep the house clean, the trees home, service to the place, clean to the home.
Inside and outside, my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, but for a long time without cleaning will be dim and lightless, only after cleaning can be shining, life is also so.
Be careful how to do can succeed, with care to shape refined, beautiful sewing we are serious.
Give me the chance, it will satisfy you, the quality explains everything, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is the most encouraged!
Every business is not good at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as the attitude is serious, persistent enough, hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least always than sitting down complaining.”
One day is counted in the morning, all the beautiful starts in the early morning I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, as you want to leave Start a new day, keep the whole day in a good mood Good morning
As a child, happiness is a thing, possession is happiness; after growing up, happiness is a goal, achieving happiness; after maturity, it is discovered that happiness is originally a state of mind, understanding is happiness.
Be the most genuine and best self, rely on it, no regrets in this life; life is one way, go its own way; life is two treasures: good body, good mood, beautiful and beautiful to live to old!
Each stage of life encounters different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability to bind you, but the courage to face it positively.
If it is impossible to avoid it, it is better to face it openly.
The more fearful you are, the more difficulty you will be beaten down; if you meet the difficulty, the problem will eventually be solved.
2, although the right in the history has a period of merit, but not long, so short is because to give a little sunlight bright, drink a little water and sweat; a little bit will have to look forward to the chief, the strike will be blown.
But in fact, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right in ending the Cultural Revolution defining the truth standards, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of politics and the protection of human rights should not be denied.
Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements, and also respect Li Weidong's person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that a revolution is not necessary, and the revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, people's livelihoods are damaged, political groups are mixed with mud, and then foreigners are in vain.
Changing or improving China’s patience and accountability for the country’s people, political speculation attempts to fire the chestnuts, that’s not the right-wing, it’s the bastard.
Talk to the left.
The left is actually a group of times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some words of the right when necessary and analyze their thoughts, then the left will not be this, because the left is what the Communist Party wants to throw away!
Fifth, recently to see some friends on the side of the thief on the left side of the fist, is still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Do not try to talk to the hunted and left-handed, it is a childish, unreasonable.
Do not try to prove that we are right, do not think of the anti-theft and left-wing admitting, why?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti-drug blasphemes you, when the left fist blasphemes your right dog, it proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget the ideals, or pursue the ideals, but become paranoid.
And the ideals gradually move away, even the killer dragon boy ends up being the evil dragon.
On the right I think that generally refers to constraints and freedom, China from the genes inherent in historical culture leading to China as a whole should be left-wing.
Domestic right-wing freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, left-wing to strengthen supervision, paying more attention to fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are in conflict, and the left is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even if I don’t understand, the compliment is over.
Nothing to say, flowers are just like that.
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of Huawei's chips has not only caused Huawei to fall into an unprecedented situation, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
U.S. pressures China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequences are the global chip suppliers' orders and profits are affected, causing chip manufacturing enterprises' R&D investment to decrease and production capacity to decrease, which has caused disruption in the global scope of the chip supply chain.
Today, the "deficiency of the core" has affected the world's major industries, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price increases, almost all industries that use chips are deeply damaged.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip", more and more countries' tech giants have begun to take the path of "decorating".
In order to firmly take control of global semiconductor control, restrict the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent U.S. action is frequent, and hosts the "chip summit"; and also invites 64 countries giants to form a semiconductor alliance, and raise funds to support U.S. domestic science and technology giants, for example, U.S. technology giant Intel to regain the dominance in the field of chips, funds $ 20 billion in the U.S. Arizona state to build two crystal processing plants, and open up the processing business of chips.
When the majority of people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain shock to Taipei Electric, and it is likely to steal the "bowl" of Taipei Electric.
The reason for this is so certain, because Intel, as the old tech giant of Meiji, has deepened in the field of semiconductors for several decades, has a large number of talents and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term, defeating Taiwan.
However, for this decision of Intel, founder Zhang Zhang has disregarded.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhong said astonishingly, for the move of Intel to fund the construction of a crystalline plant, Zhang Zhong said without hesitation: Intel to build a chip generation factory, quite ironic.
Zhang's loyalty to Intel's entry into the circular field is quite disgraceful, because Zhang's loyalty to a period of complaint about Taipei and Intel more than 30 years ago is still concerned.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been a pearl in the manufacturing industry, and is the world's leader in semiconductors.
Until the 1980s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a handful of strong people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, the chip from design, manufacture to sealing was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model leaves some small enterprises overwhelming, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, in 1984, Zhang heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a specializing in design, then it could be established a factory specialized in the manufacture of circles.
Soon after, Zhang's imagination became a reality, and the power supply came into being.
Taipei Electric focuses its main business on the single link of "circular processing", does not carry out design, but only provides cutting-edge manufacturing services.
At the time, the newly founded Taiwan-based electricity, in front of this giant, Intel, was a small thorn.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang has sought to invest in Intel, but at the time that Intel heard that Taiwan accumulator only made the manufacturing link of the chip industry, obviously some self-esteem very high, can not afford Taiwan accumulator, decidedly refused to invest in Taiwan accumulator.
Zhang also believed that Intel had disregarded the crystal process service at the time.
I didn't think that the giant of crystal manufacturing services couldn't ignore at the time, but now also start to do crystal labor.
Therefore, Zhang believes that it is ironic for Intel to enter the circle.
Today, the market value of Tencent electricity has exceeded Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of Taiwan Accumulator, Intel naturally does not dare to firmly secure itself.
Nowadays, Taipei has pushed toward a 3nm chip, while Intel is still stopping at the 14nm seven years ago.
In fact, trying to overtake is not easy.
Let’s see some strange heat searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd dragon rise, good friend price rise, warrants event, public opinion spread to form a peak, then [index drop] (flat curve) finally dissipated, if there is a secondary public opinion there will be a small hammer peak again.
They look very different from the [Network Public Opinion Evolution Model] that has been shown on the website.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, showing [Picture], [Saddle] and [Crack].
Isolated shape, that is, artificial heating, rapidly hit the list of hot searches, attracting public attention; Isolated shape, that is, cyclical heating, ensuring the theme shape of hot search list; Isolated shape, that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has played the "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of one event is exactly the valley of another event, the time is not bad in seconds, and it must be the unified batch of the navy received the task to open a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract the eye, which is responsible for the coup, which is the warfare trend, which is the shift of the eye, which affects the cognition, which is misleading judgment, which is inciting emotions, which is embroidering decisions, black production account division, node refinement operations, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, throwing away all the subjective factors of stance and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will be untouched.
Everyone who passes will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, what the headliner says is that traditional TV should refer to liquid crystal TV, and the difference in the positioning of laser TV and liquid crystal TV in the market is the following two points:
First, laser television is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the big screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product for the big screen.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally more than 75 inches, the maximum is more than 100 inches, fully satisfying the needs of users for large screen color power.
In recent years, the share of shipments and sales of laser TVs in the world has been increasing, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total sales of 80 inch and above TVs.
According to Zhejiang's forecast, in 2020, the laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the image principle of laser television long reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directly emitted into the eye, compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the image process is closer to the image process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also less.
China Institute of Electronics and Technology Standardization Scientific Laboratory and Beijing Consortium Hospital eye experts, through the strict contrast trial of people watching laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same conditions, obtained 144 groups of test data.
The data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye-protecting properties and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In the present time when visual health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Second, laser television is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs is currently more than 10,000 yuan, and the price is gradually rising with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why is laser television so expensive?
Surely it makes sense.
With the continuous development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot.
With ultra-short focal distance projection technology, laser television projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, can a 100 inch large screen experience in a short distance, the required space is not large, and the host is small, and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also feature real 4K ultra-high-definition quality, artificial intelligence systems, live screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking visual experience.
Don't talk about the fake demand, but the product of the demand segmentation, the quality of painting and input and output ratio, laser television is not a video player's dish, want to take into account the large screen and watch the environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is beneficial and bad, weigh after judging yourself, you are afraid to listen to the word.
Simply put, ultra wide-angle near-focus projectors – laser TVs, in order to stick close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which are not in line with the optical best design.
In order to block some environmental light, the use of micro-structure finer curtains, the cost is high, the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another thing, I especially hated the projection manufacturer Namer reflex to the eye good this when selling point, please, the light on the curtain can see the eye is direct light for the eye, you reflect to the ceiling, the eye can not see, if the true LCD TV is also long "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, the projection curtain would not be like if it was not a long-range reflection.
Exactly being ignored by the heat patch (light patch) effect of the high-performance curtain, a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at some angle, which is really unpleasant.
Buy an umbrella insurance?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: in accordance with the regulations of insurance brokerage regulations (revised in 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three keywords: shareholders, initiators have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, the minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very demanding, in summary, it is to have strength, to pass the approval of the State authority department of the National Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating insurance companies, banks), shareholders to have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company small umbrella insurance, insurers do not need to question the umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not any insurance company can.
In this respect, it is good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star disability insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelf and Thai Super Mary No. 5 disability insurance, the insured party and the insurer are Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, without questioning its reliability.
From the payment model perspective: Internet platform products, because of the operating costs of the business network, and the cost of business employees, so the price ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payments, reduces the payment pressure of insurers, while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
This is especially important, because insurance is a very strong industry with very strong professional requirements, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of miscarriages, in health information and occupation, non-insurance workers will often add their subjective awareness when insuring, feel healthy or fit, so there is a lot of risks, there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance phone sales at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the small umbrella, also the Internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real, also relied on spectrum, not relied on spectrum is people, Internet channels have no professional practitioners, there are a lot of sales misleading.
For example, $ 1 insurance guarantee, $ 6 million, buy insurance phone, free to receive 60,000 heavy disease guarantee, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid weight is light, will not tell the insurer, the first month $ 1, the next month is required to charge according to the normal, dozens to 200 different, many customers deduct a year or two of their own purchase is not clear.
Thinking that it could cost one dollar, the insurance company will pay six million dollars.
The free phone is sent by the special insurance number such as 6666, 8888 and if the prize text message is sent, it is not exchanged, and no one is reminded.
(This is another hole for insurers) free to receive 60,000 heavy disease guarantee, is a short-term, if only on this, no other commercial risk, if there is a serious disease, 60,000 can do nothing, can not solve the problem, later life begins naked.
Currently, the state is also struggling with the misleading of internet insurance sales.
So in a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is not a problem, there is a problem with the professionalism and professional practice of the businessman.
In fact, many off-line insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products have a better price ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured off-line products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan per person.
If you have any doubts, welcome to contact and communicate with me.
I: Minia insurance broker, has 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serves a thousand enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying for insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for customers, applying for insurance, for customers' goods compared to three, make every effort for customers to fight for the best nuclear insurance results, after applying for insurance, for customers to do insurance arrangement, insurance order custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer.
Hopefully my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business of the insurer after clicking on the insurance link, can complete all the insurance processes independently.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insurer independently.
Although internet insurance is not very "ceremonial" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts.
This pattern, a little like the ordinary "telephone sales" flow line task, but so buying insurance will also have a deadly problem, that is – follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades, and when we buy insurance, should we carefully think about this "intermediary" that we choose, is it a "intermediary" that can be accompanied by us for a long time and will also provide us with services in many years?
I have always been opposed to any form of contempt and blasphemy, much less to this type of personal assault.
In a civilized society, we can include everything, but we must eliminate this villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, we must first resist this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending a friend request on Facebook, to the time you posted a ridiculous post, to the time you tried to post my so-called home location and my father’s name on social media, I’ve been unresponsive.
Afterwards, you intensified not only on the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook and your so-called friends continued to discourage some obscene, humiliating words about me, appearance, body, good nutrition, what the strawberries in bed, if you want to insert such messages, I... also counted.
How did I know later I received several friends sending comments about your Facebook friend’s account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment content.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer keep silent.
After I uploaded the news to the police, you were not at all confused, but more and more upset.
No matter what political background you have, no matter what identity status you have, there is a need for gender respect in our society.
Yes, you can continue to make ridiculous, obscene, humiliating, insulting statements, you can continue to say you just care and care about me, you can continue to think it’s not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it’s not yours, or you can continue to make all the aggressive statements.
Yes, I cannot, nor can I, stop you.
I do not know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body do not need your commentary.
I don’t even think there would be a girl willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I say yes, you won’t believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say she’s fine after being bullied so much.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who don’t even have basic virtues choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I sent a message to all of you to criticize.
No one can pretend to be yourself.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
meet with laughter.
The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 Dover pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional report: China-US relations latest news: the latest satellite images show that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. naval arsenal rarely visited Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea strategic trend perception platform, on January 9, the satellite discovered the U.S. aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" near the Barrabac Strait.
The Strait of Barrabac, which connects the South China Sea and the Sea of Soros, is a strategic site on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier is deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Fish Eagle" shipping aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carrier, in addition to the Carl Vinson, and the USS Abraham Lincoln, departed from the United States on January 3.
For the first time, the Lincoln also carried the F-35C fleet, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Navy.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier stationed in Yokohama, Japan.
The aircraft carrier combat group also includes the missile cruiser "Shanpuran Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stockdar".
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea strategic trend perception platform released the latest satellite images, showing the three U.S. military aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. military ship-carrying aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN reports on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday.
U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China with the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam, analysts said, sending a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
It is the permanent island of China in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam reinforced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the U.S. capacity, flexibility, combat readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as “Boomer submarines.”
The trajectory of the U.S. Navy’s 14 “Thrill Submarines” is usually kept strictly secret.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine has made the “Thrill Submarine” the “most important survival weapon of the nuclear trio”, a system that also includes launching well ballistic missiles located in the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26 percent drop in Meta, the market value evaporated to $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded “facing unprecedented competition,” why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially a advertising company, the revenue comes mainly from advertising, and advertising companies that make money today, themselves have traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, regardless of the location, are all Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps outsourcing Meta ads through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple’s privacy policy now is user-friendly and will clearly tell users whether or not to allow the app to access their information, and most people’s normal response is definitely not permitted.
Next, if Google strikes another blow, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
Everybody knows that Meta does not have a business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta’s offices in Hong Kong are about a few hundred, with several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of the main competitors to Meta, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from byte.
Domestic agents are helping bytes to Meta to advertise, and the performance of Meta China is also good.
I haven’t specifically understood it lately, but it won’t be better than before.
The phase of massive money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is unsuccessful.
Facebook is getting older and the new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don’t just look at the average income, but more importantly, how it looks for the future.
Obviously, Meta’s expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talks about the “ancient universe.”
The Ancient Universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the Ancient Universe is relatively long, and this story in these two or three years should not be enough to support the market value of Meta.
So the next two years should be a more difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now very popular, there are $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue annually, in fact, Facebook is now very strong in crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is nothing good safe river.
Although several of his social software is now a relatively high daily life, is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development oftiktok, Facebook has no confidence, between the disruption is the blinking power.
And this promising and inaccessible concept of the original universe, in a short time, there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is again changing the name of the company, and the fundamental reason for continuously looking for new tracks, but I think his path choice is wrong, is a non-return path above some of my thoughts, for reference.
