First off, let me start with the conclusion. I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a all-round bad movie in every sense.
But if you say that there isn't a bright spot in this film at all, it may not mean that the soundtrack is well chosen at least.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It’s one that makes you fall asleep soundly in the movie theater, but also one that makes you feel indignant after watching it. “Four Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in numerous ways.
Han Han has absolutely great talent when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a gram novel. It is difficult to describe and has many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after seeing it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you realize that it is actually a piece of shit.
First let me briefly mention some things that I am having difficulty understanding.
The male protagonist's place of residence is expected to be a small island farther south, where he lives with his grandma.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast in a minivan to watch the snow.
Elderly people sitting in van watching snow from the south to the northeast??
He and his father were totally happy about it.
And then the old man stopped writing.
When opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the lady and her brother get the business license?
Why is it so easy for the speeding gangsters of the island to close a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped on the side of the road, and no truck drivers could be found around.
This prop feels too obvious.
Why would a young gangster with bad credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't they appeal to the police when faced with loan sharking, in the film, the police even asked if there was any problem?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone but doesn’t know how to use a key card to open the door at a hotel, then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside his room and sleep for a night?
These kinds of inexplicable plots are present throughout the entire film, and they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what is worse is the subject matter of the movie, or the fact that the movie has no subject at all, other than a disgusting stitcher.
When the film begins, you think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you may guess that it is an inspirational film, and halfway through watching it you think it may be a drama that shows the difficulty of survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don’t even know what you are seeing. What follows is deep doubts about yourself, and why would you go to the cinema to enjoy shit at the big New Year?
To most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you can add inspiration and comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie can work to achieve success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you have to be honest about the feud between a small town teenager who likes to ride a motorcycle and a girl who is a waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot feature anything that’s contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role played by Yin Zheng who was able to sing after his new motorcycle got burned down just now) doesn't allow him to open up some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand watching.
As for the heroine, she is not mentally retarded but in some ways she acts like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know whether this is because of her acting ability or if it is the director's request.
There’s one thing that I don’t understand, why Han Han, being a racing driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own films?
Is it possible that such a movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival stalls to create confusion for the audience?
Thanks to our supporters today, all 80 boxes have been sent away!

I want to try tennis, but I feel scared that I won’t be able to continue, so I want to find a similar price first for practicing.
Unfriendly. In fact, price tends to be proportional to friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, expensive beats will generally be friendlier than cheap beats. These "entry shoots" are actually industrial waste.
They are so low on intensity that the ball hits the rackets and is very vibrating, hard balls can't bear them and even a pro would have trouble handling them.
The logic and subtext of their existence are—Tennis is so difficult, you know you can’t learn it, and you’re unwilling to buy expensive ones, and be fooled with cheap stuff, so you will not play again after playing twice. In this way, it is cheap and you don’t feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish the good from the bad, it shows that you have made progress. Then come buy expensive ones from me and I will make twice as much money.
It is recommended to pay a similar price and buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough so they don’t sell for great price. New rackets are just as good at 500 or 600, and second-hand ones are 200. Wouldn’t it be good to own a thousand yuan racket?
It is very friendly to newbies, but once it gets past the newbie stage, it becomes useless. Most people, especially girls, can’t get past the newbie stage.

What's hot in 2021?
It’s undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, there is a very popular article, “Look! The Olympic Games that Project Managers Can Qualify For Gold”, it mentions that the project managers can definitely lead in many projects. No one can match them: Carrying bricks, travelling for business, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers, and fighting fires, backing the blame and making apologies are not a problem.
This article may seem to be a joke, but it also brings out the bitterness of the daily affairs of project managers, which reflects their inability to manage current projects.
Personnel engaged in project management work gradually choose to take certain actions to free themselves from the difficulties in their work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to "China’s Project Management Development Report in the Twenty Years, 1999-2019", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of applicants for PMP® test in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people passing PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total PMP® certificate holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which means that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to simply copy past “old experiences”. The rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we need to learn and explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can taking the PMP exam ensure smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other relevant knowledge points, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: Inadequate project management knowledge, solely relying on personal experience, lack of project management theory, and not knowing how to practice; Lack of systematic project management procedures and system support, unable to implement the process at work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delaying the project again and again; the members’ labor division is not very clear and the “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with the lack of smooth inter-departmental assistance and communication, which makes the project difficult to come forward.
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers. It has won the honorary titles such as "Chinese Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and brought the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course is an online fragmented learning method combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions for project managers and embark on the advanced road to your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, thus bringing efficient operating results to enterprises.
Let’s see what other students say about this course. The course is not only a professional explanation of the course content that is presented in simple language by our expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei’s R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios from many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students transform their learned content into specific work after class.
It is said that the supercar exhaust sound is the loudest in Xinshan area!
This car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago—Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is almost 2 million ringgits, the annual road tax is more than 10,000 ringgits, and four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don’t know. The data said that 0-100km/h only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate, and probably by the time my myvi just turns to 30km/h, it’s already 100km/h, eh.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes spread all over the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine clearly seen under the glass perfectly describe the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, and everyone is watching wherever I go, making me feel uncomfortable! (It's actually kind of cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
You need to practice how to get on or off the car, otherwise it will look a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the car cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine sound is so loud, that once you get out of the car you will be deaf. (But it is still very cool)
The car is too big, and if you park in a normal parking space, it will be very narrow and you’d be afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door opens!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don’t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are known to all car fans. Chiron is one of the most expensive super cars in the world, and Porsche 911 is also worth millions!
That day, thousands of sports cars 911s and tens of millions of supercars Chirons were crashed in foreign countries in just a few minutes!
Judging by the results, it's worth it!
At a time when NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic have begun to earn stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds US$8.2 million, nearly equal to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of the blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend’s stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the companies on the track, which means the choice of the investment target industry. First, I must choose an industry with a large room for growth, at least a market size of 100 billion or more; secondly, I must choose an industry that has good future growth potential, and consider the industry with the best growth rate in the next 3-5 years; ﬁnally, choose industries that have policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive landscape.
Cheer on the right tracks!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics are all about ‘doing the things right’, which means doing things right.
The strategy is to “do the right thing,” which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding the direction, and tactics is about landing. On top of most tactical thinking there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether to continuously deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking). For example, on improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct campaign goals such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers. On enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years into its existence, Bitcoin will reach several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, a small Central American country, El Salvador, designated Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the American capital markets, once again expanding cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Mr. Lin, a family member of the owner of the building, on the details of the purchase of the factory building and then remitted 200,000 yuan via bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on a "Plant Sales Deposit Receipt", which states, "If the buyer does not wish to buy this plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller is not willing to sell this plant, then the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. The two sides agree to sign the plant sale contract within one week."
However, both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the major contract terms including the scope of plant sales, payment method, etc., hence delaying the signing of the residential housing sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally paying the deposit and having the payment ready, the owner finally settled the house and agreed to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell. This caused Mr. Lu to feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People’s Court.
After hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract. The blame cannot only be on the defendant, so it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation has failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for deposit shall not apply in the case, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability for breaching the contract by returning the deposit double.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer's Reminder】You must exercise the necessary prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, a buyer must exercise the necessary obligations of due diligence, such as checking the owner’s information, whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the two sides when implementing the contract.

You are confused and fear that this is a scam.
He hands you a business card, and you discover that he's really the director of a major Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to discuss the compensation. The salary must be indispensable."
You came to the company with him in a little confused way. He said he saw you on the street right away and really hoped you could come and participate.
You think you have nothing to lose and you can still make money, so you sign a contract.
It's a large-scale romance reality show that's divided into two parts.
In the early stage, stars and amateurs will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.

The official recording starts next week. You don’t know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
I accidentally stumbled across the following article. It talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to help with canning from a commercial and shelf life perspectives, although canning is a deep-processing business and does not fall within the scope of operations of the bonded logistics company. The following text might explain why the client wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged milk powder and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags is one year while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are same, but most people think that the expensive ones are the better ones.
There are also consumers who have this attitude and they will say the taste or taste of the cans is different after eating them!
Now I would like to talk to you first about the reasons why listening devices are expensive. Where are the prices?
Why is there such a large difference in price for the same raw materials?
Most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit. So what can the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So, they now have a big increase in the price of their cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging instead of bag packaging.
Also, you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions in advertising fees each year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, market promotion expenses, such as sales staff in shopping malls, exhibition fees at shopping malls, gift fees for products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, especially if they are canned, and their prices are also increasing. In fact, these are new products that come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the additional cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that use all possible means to promote their own products. They are linked with the doctors in hospitals. They will assist in promoting the product and take a profit ranging from RMB30 to RMB80.
But China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow the aforementioned methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy the milk powder in bags and put them in the cans if you have a can at home. This saves costs and increases the preservation and sealing of milk powder. This will not have any impact on the children.
Also, don't think the shelf life of cans is longer than those in bags. If the shelf life of the cans and bags is the same after unpacking, it's just that the bags will not be easy to store after they are opened, and will tend to be deteriorated due to moisture.
Just saw an article about the menstrual period. It is too long.
Let me give some information to guys who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period someday between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea will occur around the age of 50.
From then on, provided you are healthy, you will come here on a regular basis once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to be able to forecast accurately. There is a tolerance of about a week and need to prepare in advance. Sometimes because of bad luck, the car will roll over (suddenly be several days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
Menstrual periods are uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours over the days from the beginning to end. The only thing I can do is suction blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent blood coming on my clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen in a short period of time whilst beginning the menstrual period can effectively relieve pain of that month. It is not useful to take it after the menstrual cramps start.
Before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If during the cycle, you have unexpected diarrhea, generally menstruation can happen within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise, they are likely to breed bacteria and eliminate sleep time. In a worst-case scenario, they may need to be replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which means 42 pieces. If you add the amount prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, rather than one piece every month.
(Modify it here. The tampons don’t have to be changed often. They should be changed every five to six hours, a maximum of eight hours)
During the menstrual period, hormonal troubles may be more violent, and during the ovulation period, the mood will be unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which means that it is very unlucky, and the body makes trouble for itself.
But official crime rate data shows that women’s ability to control emotions is still very high, and they won’t use emotional problems as excuses.
It’s not just the blood that is flowing, it contains the shed lining of the uterus.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and gradually thickens after that. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Each month a house will be built (the endometrium becomes thicker) for welcoming the guests. When the guests do not come, they will be completely demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house will be built next month, and again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, I’ve been bleeding for 24 hours a few days a month, and still have abdominal pain and low back pain. Who would want it?
But a human being can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare you for being in the house for 10 months when you first enter the world. Everyone should thank your mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everybody thought that was like that, but times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and that women's body is disgusting for the preparations they make for life, they shouldn't say it in public, girls stand up, stop thinking about it, men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't understand anything very well, don't be so ungrateful and not knowing what the hell will be, how can I be so embarrassed to face my mother and want my child through such an attitude?
Finally, sisters, let’s try tampons, they really work!
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception via rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from "the Book of Changes·Xishixang", "The metaphysical is called Tao, and the physical is called equipment", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns merely represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism represents the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the way of research that leaves no mention of God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of the moral life of human beings; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct agreed upon by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics (which abstractly studies the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (which assesses different moral views and gives moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.)
It studies what style of moral code of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (the science that applies ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collects information about how people live and summarizes them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics proceeds not from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the ethical factors that drive such decisions, and it examines the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part one: Ethical thoughts of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical thoughts of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part three: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17 to语八 Century: British empiricist ethics, representative: Hume, etc., 17-18 centuries: European rationalism ethics, representative: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, 18-19 century, British utilitarianism and others.
Logic is a discipline that studies “principles and standards for effective inference and proof.”
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject that studies the nature of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our friends for their humanitarian aid over a long period of more than 30 years after our relatives died. In particular, since I issued an appeal for humanitarian aid in my own name to friends both at home and abroad in early 1994, the aid has remained uninterrupted so far.
Now most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started their own families and have jobs.
It was your acts of generosity that helped our families in distress through the hardest of times.
The current coronavirus pandemic is raging around the world and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop your donations to our relatives - Tiananmen Mothers group. It is already long overdue for this humanitarian aid activity to come to an end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your actions will forever be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand, friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Taoye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid between the IFCSS and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the IFCA and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the families of victims of the June 4th incident.
In 1994, upon suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan’s Education Fund”; 11 years later, in 2009 when all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF further set up “June 4th Orphaned Elderly and Specially needy Household Relief Fund,” which has been implemented till today.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations during June Fourth, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It was not until last year that after a lapse of 31 years, the families of those affected by the June 4th Movement finally received a donation from Hong Kong that had been raised in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped June 4 donation for the sake of donors. We are all retired seniors, and their income is not as abundant as before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his letter “To Friends”.
We will respect the families' decision to terminate the program within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express gratitude and respect to the brave fellow comrades who have insisted on generously giving and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.
A programming newbie who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for the training. However, if you have no idea in this aspect, it is better to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you plan to get into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice. Especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have stronger self-control, you can choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, let’s look at the strength of faculty of this institution. If the faculty are not powerful enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, it is best to inquire about the students who come from this institution. After all, only students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact I don't know how to answer that question you asked, because I have not given any specific introduction to your own situation, and learning this matter has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from computer science, I personally propose you to self study if you have time, as this is the most efficient and cost-effective alternative. Many offline and online training institutions are actually very good nowadays, but learning costs are high, and the time investment is greater and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is like the situation I have mentioned, it is very convenient to study by yourself. Many learning resources are now free on the Internet. There are also many training resources available at Station B. If you cannot find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources or provide detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time, then it is suggested to study at a training institution. This way, learning will not be tedious, the teacher will explain in detail, and someone can answer if you have any questions. In addition, it helps in study planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and offer internal referral quotas. After studies they can recommend you to a company so that you can save a lot of time during the following job interviews.
The above are some of my opinions. Since I do not know your situation, I only briefly introduce it, without going into detail. If you have other things you want to ask, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamp installations, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who give me praise silently, I worked hard for my life, life is very tiring but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint people who work hard. Just follow me if you like and thank all those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only look at the results and support the process on their own, facing life, we have to remain strong and do not have any other choice. There is no turning back. We can look back but we cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we are doing the most dirty work when it comes to cleaning, we will take the most serious attitude to cleaning every corner of the client's house. When we see satisfied smiles and thumbs up from clients, all the hard work will be worth it at that instant, and all the efforts will pay off!
My daily job
─Your request, my service.
Serve carefully, clean attentively, and retain beauty.
For the details that you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping can help you do everything you can to "clean" and serve the loving family.
Ensure the cleanliness of every home, set up household management monuments, deliver in-place services, and make the home pristine.
In-door and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will turn dull if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine. That is the case in life as well.
We can be successful only by endeavouring to do it with attention; we create exquisiteness with detail. We are serious about the beauty of stitching.
Give me a chance, you will definitely be satisfied, the quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
Things are not working well in all industries today!
But I always believe that as long as I act seriously, persistently, and work hard, I will be better than others – at least it will be better than just sitting and complaining!"
The plan for the day starts in the morning, all beautiful things start in the morning. I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health and good wishes, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When you are a child, happiness is a thing, and it’s a matter of having it; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, and when you achieve it, you will be happy; when you’re mature, you discover that happiness is a state of mind, and the realization is a matter of happiness.
Be the most true and kindest self, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is one life path, and one's own way; there are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and living beautifully to old age!
At every stage of life we encounter different difficulties.
Many times, the thing holding you back is not your ability, but rather the courage to face it positively.
Since you can’t avoid it, it’s better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be struck down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will eventually be solved.
2. Although the rightist has a great era in history, it is not very long, and so short because if you get a little sunshine you will become glorious, and if you drink some boiling water, you will sweat; if they get a little daring, they will gain the utmost advantages and become swayed when they are attacked.
But truthfully speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the perspective of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I care deeply about his comments and have respect for Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes Chinese social issues seriously.
But I disagree with his anti-Communist theories. I believe that the anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, compromising the livelihood of the people, mixed political groups, and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and people. Those who attempt to gain opportunities through political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left:
The Left, in reality, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive meaning to the society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right’s words and analyze their thoughts whenever needed, then the Left will not have this good fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently I saw some friends who are shaking against the traitors while refuting the idiocy of leftists. They were very annoyed. I don’t think it’s necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and Zuozhi, they are both mean and unreasonable.
Don’t try to prove that we are right, let alone make the rebels and left psychopaths admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you the 50 cents and when the leftist calls you the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they get old, they forget them or pursue them but then become paranoid.
And the ideal goes further and further away, and even the dragon slayer boy eventually turns into an evil dragon.
Left and right, I think, generally refers to restraint and freedom. The inherited genes of China's history and culture mean that China as a whole should be to the left.
While the domestic right wing is liberal and focused on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness and security.
The general expectation in society now is to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, because of the disputes between China and the US, it is certain that it will slant to the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't quite understand it, just give it a thumbs up and that's it!
Don't say anything, Huahua is so faithful
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the United States has not only brought Huawei into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to “US-based” companies.
The American imperialists are suppressing China's chip industry and requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises from allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and reduced production capacity by chip manufacturers. This has resulted in the disorder of a global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, “chip shortage” has spread to major industries around the world. For example, automobile companies have stopped production, and mobile phone prices have increased. Almost all industries that use chips have been greatly affected by it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
To firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States recently took several actions to host the "chip summit"; they also invited the 64 largest country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and funded the support of local American tech giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, the old American technology giant Intel spent 20 billion USD to build two wafer processing factories in Arizona, and opened the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel’s move would have a certain impact on TSMC and would likely take away TSMC’s “job”.
The reason for this is because Intel, a veteran tech giant of the USA, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserve. It will certainly be able to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive of Intel’s decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark. Regarding Intel's move to build a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been the jewel of the US Empire’s manufacturing industry, held the top position in the world, and was the hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, production, packaging and testing were all undertaken by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to stand back in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry started to see a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation after the 1980s. In 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s vision became reality and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business towards a single link of “wafer processing” and does not conduct design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was merely a small player in front of the Intel giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou sought an investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only engaged in manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously very self-conscious, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer processing services at the time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel’s entry into the foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC’s market value has surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with the strong attack from TSMC, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It’s not easy to catch up.
Let’s take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were selected randomly: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Orion, and the goods pull event. The public opinion spread out to form a peak, and then the index decline (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If the secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump that will appear again.
They appear to be the same as the "Evolution Model of Internet Public Opinion" once displayed on the official website of the CNCA.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lonely peak], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Ground-shaped] means artificial heating, rapidly rushing to the hot search and attracting attention of the public; [Jagged] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic occupy the hot-search list; [cliff-shaped] means a group withdrawal, the hot search has finished its "function", received a new assignment and rushed towards the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of an event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is accurate in every minute. It must have been a unified batch of military forces receiving the task, kicking off a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones attract battles, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir up emotion and which are coercive decision making. The black-produced accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking almost all elements of the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, considering only objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Everywhere we walk, there will be traces left. Let's dig them out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in the market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products designed for big screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales volume of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by laser light source does not enter the eyeball directly. Compared with backlight light of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and the irritation to the eyes is smaller.
Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute, and ophthalmology experts of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, came up with 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparative tests of audience's watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm霾 that laser TV indeed has strong eye protection properties, and even has certain improvement effects in certain areas.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the laser TVs currently available on the market are priced above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, prices have gradually climbed.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
This definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technological level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection machines, achieving a 100-inch big-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is compact and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus, the heat generated is lower, losses to devices are small, and the lifespan of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-HD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. When it comes to picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not an option for audio-visual players. If you want to take note of a large screen and an insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its own pros and cons. You can judge on your own after weighing it, but you are afraid to hear one-sided words.
To put it simply, an ultra-wide-angle close-focus projector, a laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optimal optical design.
In order to block some of the ambient light, it is expensive to use a microstructured Fresnel screen, and the price of the 80-inch LCD can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another thing: I especially hate when the projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point antagonistic to the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that an eye can see is a direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, your eyes will not be able to see it. If you must be more realistic, LCD TV is also diffusely "direct" so even if you turn on the TV, the ceiling will also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not have a diffuse reflection, it cannot form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of higher gain screens is just ignored and a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: as prompted in "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", three key words must be satisfied to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders and promoters must have no major violation record in the recent 3 years, a minimum threshold of RMB 50 million can be established, and approval must be obtained from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three rules are actually very harsh. In summary, they have to have strength. They must go through approval by the State-authorized department of China Banking Regulatory Commission (oversees insurance companies and banks across the country) and shareholders have a good style of conduct. As an insurance brokerage company, the policyholder needn’t doubt whether the umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds that cannot be met by all insurance companies.
On this point, it is not bad and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super-Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. Both the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment model perspective: Internet platform products are generally more cost-effective because of the lower cost of operating outlets and staff wages. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing paying pressure on policy holders and at the same time leveraging insurance leverage to the greatest extent possible.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism of the salesman: This is particularly important because insurance is a very professional industry. Many Internet product customers can take out insurance on their own, and there would be many misunderstandings in this case. Regarding health information and occupation, non-insurance professionals tend to add their own subjective awareness when they apply for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or eligible for insurance. This is likely to lead to many hidden dangers in claim settlement and the risk of being denied claims.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, which also serves as an internet insurance brokerage platform) then I would like to tell everyone in very responsible manner.
Insurances on the Internet are genuine and reliable; the unreliable are people. The Internet channels do not have professional practitioners and there are also many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance policy is 6 million, buy insurance to get a cell phone, and get 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid important issues, and would not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month, the next month requires the usual fee, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for a year or two and they are confused about what they bought.
I thought that I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell like a pie).
Free mobile phone delivery is available only in special policy number sections such as 6666 and 8888 at the end of the policy. If the winning text message is sent, it will not be exchanged, and there will be no one to remind you.
(This is another pitfall to the policyholder.) The free critical illness insurance amount of 60,000 is short-term, and if we only rely on this, we don’t have other commercial insurances. In case a serious disease really occurs, what can we do with 60,000, the problem will not be solved, and our future life will start streaking.
At present, the government is also cracking down on misleading online insurance sales.
So looking at things comprehensively, there is no problem with the platform and no problems with the product. What’s problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
I recommend that you give the subject a comprehensive and careful consideration. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, and customers can choose from more opportunities and products. Some of their products are also more cost effective than Internet products.
I have personally helped 59 Internet customers, by underwriting offline products, and saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, who has had 3-year experience in enterprise management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, has partnered with more than 100 insurance companies. Before buying insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance process, I will shop around for customers to try to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insured, I will organize and keep insurance policies for customers, to make customers feel at ease.
We grow with every customer throughout their life.
I hope my answer is helpful to you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is the insurance business in which a policyholder can complete all the insurance application process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policy applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the policy applicant.
Although purchasing insurance through internet is not too “ceremonial” and there may not be even printed paper contracts, but this does not in any way affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contracts.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of “telephone sales,” but there is also a fatal problem when purchasing insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When purchasing insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” that we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that will accompany us for a long time and provide us with services for many years to come?
From past to current, I have always been against any form of slander and abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilised society we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such villains.
If we don't pay attention to political parties and factions, the first thing we must resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the time you started posting Facebook friend requests, and then with your ridiculous posts, to your attempts to publish my home location and father's name on social media, I have become unresponsive.
After that, you intensified your actions and not only continued to tag me based on your frequency of six meals a day, but also continued talking about obscure humiliating words about me over Facebook, with your so-called friends, about my appearance, figure, good fertility, any message like putting strawberry in bed, or not. I… forget it.
Somehow I have received several further comments from friends about a photograph of you being uploaded on your Facebook friends account and remarks that contained sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl I can't remain silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was posted, you showed no restraint, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you have. In our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes you can continue with the ridiculous, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments and you can continue to say shallowly that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to consider it not harassment, you can continue denying it was not your drawing or keep making everything offensive.
Yes, I cannot and have no power to stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment about my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for being famous.
A friend asked me: Are you okay?
I said yes, you wouldn’t believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say she’s okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice exists in people's hearts.
I cut up a section of the message for you to comment
No one can impersonate you when posting your own post.
All I can say is you are the enemy of civilization.
Smile with understanding
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China during a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional, pro-CCP media reports from many dimensions: Latest news about China-U.S. relations: the latest satellite images show the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the United States media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Naval arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to America’s allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson is deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the U.S. aircraft carriers currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean include the "USS Abraham Lincoln" who set off from the United States on January 3.
USS Lincoln also featured for the first time a squadron of F-35C carrier aircraft which was part of the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently has the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
Three U.S. military aircraft carriers are gathered around China and make rare visits to Guam with their most powerful weapons. On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing three U.S. military aircraft carriers assembled around China.

(Twitter @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report on January 17 by CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China, and made a rare visit to Guam. Analysis said this was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers pack their most powerful weapons around China and make a rare visit to Guam. China has constructed a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines.”
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder" submarines in the United States Navy fleet are generally kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine “the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad,” a system that also includes siloed ballistic missiles on the U.S. mainland as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he is facing “unprecedented competition.” What’s the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue comes mainly from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest “advertising network”. Many apps add advertisements on Meta and then realize the monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to adjustments in Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to acquire user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their own information. Most people's normal response is definitely not to allow it.
And if Google stabs again next time, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue every year comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta employs several hundred people in the Hong Kong office and has several major agents in mainland China.
When Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it in detail lately, but it's definitely not going to be better than before.
The stage when Chinese firms were burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, but lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly looks at future expectations.
Obviously Meta’s expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse."
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be difficult times for Meta.
Regardless of the popularity of Facebook, it also generates revenue of $100 billion to $200 billion a year. In fact, Facebook is feeling a serious crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it doesn't have any good security moat.
Although several of his social software have relatively high daily activities and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is only a blink of an eye.
As for the elusive and unattainable concept of the Metaverse, there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the basic reason why Zuckerberg changes the company’s name and keeps looking for the new track. However, I feel that his choice of track is wrong, and it is a road of no return. These are some of my thoughts for reference.
