First of all, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad film, in all senses.
But if you want to say that the film is not a bright spot, it's not at least a good soundtrack choice.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It's one that allows you to sleep soundly in the cinema, and it's one that allows you to feel righteous and indignant after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature from the novel, and it's indescribable. It's like a trench coat on Little Marco's body.
Even after watching it, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, you find that it's actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I'll simply talk about some episodes that I'm hard to understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother's fate.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and the plot arranged for a big man in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Older people watching snow from the south to the northeast in a van?
He and his dad are still very relieved about it.
Then the old man didn't follow.
How does the hostess brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's Flying Car Party jerk lightly close a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering rebar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't find it all around.
This prop sensation is too obvious.
Why would a small-mix fly-truck party with no credit and suspicion of illegality become a auxiliary police?
In the face of usury why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also asked whether it's difficult?
An adult understands the use of a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner, sitting outside the door of the room for a night's sleep?
This inexplicable plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall it throughout the film.
Beyond the plot, what's worse is the film's thrust, or that the movie doesn't have a thrust at all, is an abominable-looking stitching weirdo.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through watching it, you thought that it might be a drama that wanted to embody the difficulties of survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you simply didn't know what you had actually watched. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself. Why did you want to run to the cinema to admire the shit?
For most people, it's actually very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love movie, tell the truth about the feud between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and his waitress.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least your plot can't show up with something that's contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's character, whose new motorcycle just burned and then can sing, can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't even watch.
As for the hostess who is clearly not mentally retarded to behave like a 5-year-old in some ways, I don't know whether that's the reason for the acting or the director's request.
I also can't quite understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crashes to his own movies.
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stall to add a jam to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't persevere, so I want to find a practicing hand at a similar price.
Not friendly. In fact, the price tends to be proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it can't be distinguished, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat. Such "starter shots" are actually industrial waste.
They are very low-intensity, the ball hits the top of the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't resist, and the master is very difficult to handle.
The logic and subtext of their existence is -- tennis is so difficult, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you don't want to buy expensive goods, make a cheap fool of you, and you play twice, and you won't play again, so that the beat is cheap, and you won't be distressed.
When you can really tell the difference between the good and the bad, it shows that you have progressed, and come back to me in time to buy the expensive one. I earn twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Denglupu's. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell at the price. A new 500 or 600 is very good. The second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan of rackets, is it not pleasant to enjoy?
It's very friendly to the novice, but once the novice stage is over, it's too bad. But most people, especially the girls, can't get past the novice stage.

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It's the Tokyo Olympics, no doubt.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was a "Quick Look! Olympic Projects in which Project Managers Can Impact Gold Medals" article that was very hot. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can: lifting bricks, traveling for work, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers. Fighting fires, backing pots, and apologies are not the case.
An article that seems to joke and spoof, but also tells the daily poignancy of the project managers, behind which is not enough for the current project management.
And the personnel engaged in project management, also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
From the annual climb of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) enrollment, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP ® applicants in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP ® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid license holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
The number of PMP license holders has increased year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past. The rapidly changing work environment lets us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth management of the project?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP / IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically grasp the ten major areas of project management and the five process groups and other relevant knowledge points, but when you truly carry out the project management work, you are still in a daze.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: Project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land at work, project estimation is not accurate, poor control sensitivity, project delays; unclear division of labor among members, "old oil bars" in the team do not know how to cope with cross-department assistance communication is not smooth, project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has focused on product innovation and R & D management for more than 10 years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R & D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other online courses have come with the "R & D Project Manager Special Camp".
The online course "R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D-based enterprises to help you grasp the necessary knowledge and standard actions of the project manager and embark on the progressive path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and to bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
Without a word of mouth, you can first look at what other students say about this course: This course is not only conducted by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to carry out an in-depth and professional explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the content of learning into concrete work after class.
It is claimed that the exhaust sound of ultra-running in the new mountainous area is the largest!
This time our team brought this car to you, it is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship ultramarathon and Murcielago's replacement model - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM2 million. A year's road tax is RM10,000. Four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That counts Xiaobi also doesn't know. The data says that 0-100km / h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. It's probably that Xiaobi's myvi will get to 100km / h when it's 30km / h, well.
The low body, bustling scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and unobstructed 6.5 v12 engines under the glass perfectly exemplify the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car model, Google it yourself for a moment, and Xiaobi has sorted out some commentary that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too high-profile, everyone is watching everywhere they go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit refreshing)
1km oil money around RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
You should practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, or it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you'll be deaf when you get off. (It's still very refreshing, though)
The body is too big, parking in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, I'm afraid to be knocked when the next car opens the door!
It's a bit lonely, because there's no opponent on the road (Xiaobi own said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video's ultra run is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!
More information about cars you don't know is available at The Car Guide / People's Auto Register
It's involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that the Chiron is one of the most expensive ultra runs in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is a million rating!
That day ago, foreign countries crashed out of millions of sports cars in just a few minutes 911 and 10 million ultra-run Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
At a time when NFTs are on fire, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost jobs due to the pandemic have started to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-farming game with blockchain technology as the ground-breaking level. It brings together a variety of gameplay methods, including NFTs. It is currently the most traded NFT project, and has exceeded $3 billion as of now.
According to Token Terminal, Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million a day, pushing straight for "King's Glory."
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that it had more than 1 million daily users.
The fervor of "Axie Infinity" passes a new "paly toearn" mode to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, the player is no longer a single character. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, he can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game's makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news report on the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises on the racetrack, which is to refer to the choice of the investment target industry. First, we must choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; Second, we must choose an industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth after the next 3-5 years; Finally, we must choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is referring to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustments to the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do it right", which is to do it right.
And the strategy is to do "other right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find a direction, and the tactic is to land. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to deepen continuously in the current field or extend it horizontally (strategic thinking); on top of improving the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of enhancing activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as enhancing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silencers, and accurately pulling new; on top of enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has hit several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities Regulatory Commission approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, and the re-expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" that improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant in Yuyao Zhangding Town, Zhejiang Province, from a housing agent. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu held consultations with the family of the homeowner, Lin Mou, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted RMB200,000 through bank transfer for the deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Sale and Deposit Receipt", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit goes to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The parties agreed to sign the contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, afterwards, the two sides failed to reach agreement on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the plant sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
It's not easy to see the house, the deposit was paid, the house money was ready, and the contract was signed "on the doorstep", but the seller didn't sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the blame could not be attributed to the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the consultation failed. Therefore, the penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for the breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the verdict.
[The lawyer reminds] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise the duty of care and prudence.
When signing a contract, the buyer should perform the necessary duties of careful attention, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and to clarify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when fulfilling the contract.
Your name is Zheng Shi, and this is the second week of your move to Japan.
You walk in the street and suddenly find someone following you. You go faster and faster in fear and end up running.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait!" (Japanese dialog) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. I think you're beautiful. Are you interested in a reality show?"
You're confused, afraid it's a scam.
He stuffed you a business card and you found out that he was really the director of a major Japanese entertainment company.
"If the lady has time, we can go to the company and talk about it. The pay won't be small."
When you were confused, you came to the company with him. He said that he saw you in the street at a glance, and he very much hoped that you would come.
You think there's nothing to lose, you can make money, and you sign the contract.
It's a big love reality show, in two parts.
The early stage will let the stars and amateurs get along in real life, and cultivate a tacit understanding.
Later on, they will enter the game to jointly break through.
Official recording will start next week, and you don't know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
inadvertently saw the following article, from the commercial point of view and the preservation period, to talk about why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded area to help do the canning, although the canning is deep processing, not within the scope of the business of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contacted a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are identical to the listening milk powder, and their raw materials are not different.
Then you will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags a year, and the shelf life of audition is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the difference between the price of listening and bagging so large?
In fact, many consumers from this point, or mom-grade, think that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but what everyone thinks is expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or taste of listening attire is not the same after eating out of this mindset.
Now let me tell you the reason for pretending to be expensive, where is it?
Their raw materials are the same Why is the price difference so large?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most take into account that if the pricing of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept them. This means that the profits generated by manufacturers are low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a large margin of increase in the pricing of listening attire to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening clothing, not bagging.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising each year. What's the cost?
You can imagine it.
Then, with the development of society, the marketing costs of the market, for example: the promoters of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the cost of gifting products, the advertising costs, etc., are also constantly increasing.
So various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it's listening clothing, and its price is constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase of market expenses.
The main purpose is to make higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked to the doctors of the hospital, who assist in the promotion of the products, from a sound inside the profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods and methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bags of milk powder into the tin on the premise that they have a can at home, which can save money, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and it has no impact on small children.
Also, you should not think that the shelf life of the listening pack is longer than that of the bag. If the shelf life of the listening pack is the same as that of the bag after opening the bag, it is only said that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, and is susceptible to moisture and deterioration.
Just saw an article with a fake routine. It's too long.
Give a Cop to a man who doesn't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first official holiday someday between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be amenorrhea around the age of 50.
Then, on the premise of good health, you will come once a month on a more regular basis.
But it's not regular enough to predict it accurately. About a week or so of tolerances need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the luck will flip (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstruation vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people a week; some people have less flow, some people have a big blood collapse; some people have no reaction. Some people have pain in the ambulance, and their menstruation will change with time. Previously, it doesn't mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation can't be controlled, bleeding for 24 hours in the first few days to the end, and all you can do is suck blood with a sanitary towel or tampon to prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. Eating ibuprofen quickly when the physiological period first does not have time to dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain in the month. Eating it after the dysmenorrhea begins is not helpful.
Pre-biotic period due to uterus congestion and excessive release of prostaglandin, easy to pull the stomach.
If it's about the cycle, inexplicably pulling your stomach, you'll basically menstruate in two days.
Sanitary napkins should best be replaced in two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to breeding bacteria. In addition to the sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month. That's 42 tablets. If you add the pre-prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, and you don't use one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, the tampon doesn't have to change constantly, it can be changed once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body makes a stumble on itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they don't make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and after that it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is the house. Every month, the house (the endometrium thickened) is built to greet the guests. The guests do not come. All are demolished (the menstrual discharge) and new houses are built next month, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades on end, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and low back pain in the abdomen, who wants?
But a person can be born because his mother came to menstruate. The menstruation is to prepare you for 10 months of living in a house when you first came into the world. Everyone should thank their mother for regularly and healthyly coming to menstruate.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed. Society brainwashed women and said it was dirty and shameful. People thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation behavior of women's bodies for life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think about it again. Men who have never experienced it, will not experience it in their lives, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful. How can this attitude be nice to face their mother, and how can it be nice to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which are really good to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be solved directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "The metaphysical is the way, the metaphysical is the instrument" in the "I Ching • Therapy Upload". It is translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inou (Meiji era) by metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent the real existential entity, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural justification, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method naturalism, on the other hand, refers to research methods that do not put a word on God.
Spiritual philosophy is the philosophical branch of the study of the essence of consciousness and their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and the flesh.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline that systematically thinks and studies the moral life of human beings; here, ethics is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judge a variety of ethical views, and give moral guidelines for correct or wrong behavior.
It examines what style of ethical code of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (applied to academics in real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collected information about how people live, summarized from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the predicted theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice, and examines the ethical outlook held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethics of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethics of the religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli et al., and Modern Ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethic, represented by: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academy ethic, represented by: Kant and Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by: Bentham and Siquiwick et al., British evolutionary ethics, represented by: Spencer and Huxley et al., later in the 19th century, by German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by: Li Keel et al., by neo-Helwaldist ethics
Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retroactive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is the subject of research on the essence of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all friends for their humanitarian relief over the 30-year long period after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian relief to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and so far, the relief has not been interrupted.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and started employment.
It is your righteousness that has helped our families through the most difficult times.
At present, the new epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have retired each year.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop giving us difficult - Tian'anmen Mother Group humanitarian donations, this humanitarian relief activity is long overdue to draw the perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, and ask my friends to forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
According to: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance by the Full Aesthetics Self Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, Full Aesthetics Self Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project's implementers often intersect.

The relief money often can't be delivered smoothly on June 4.
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of Taoist relief funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4 Education Fund for Orphans", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4 orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then established the "June 4 orphaned elderly special hardship fund", and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations in June 4, from generous contributions from individuals, and are supported by the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, it was difficult for people in June 4 to finally receive a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June 4.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's call to stop the June 4 donation is for the donor's consideration. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to thank Teacher Ding for his "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the difficult decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have persisted in generosity and risked delivering humanitarian aid for many years.
A little bit of programming that wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have an idea in this regard, it's best to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and you have to take six months to learn.
But if it's going to hit the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but you will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, explore this training institution before choosing it. It is best to explore the students coming out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know exactly how this institution is, and the courses explained are good or not good.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there's no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, or even in which city, these will have to do with the profession you study or want to pursue.
If you are a student and haven't graduated, or have graduated from computer majors, then if there is enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the least efficient and costly. Nowadays, many offline training institutions are actually very good. However, once the cost of study is high, the time devoted to the second is relatively high. It basically needs to be concentrated for 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the network are now free, or there are a lot of training resources to go to Station B. If you don't look for resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is OK.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time cost of study, it is recommended to study in a training institution. This way, it is not very laborious to study. The teacher explained in detail, and there are questions and people specially answered. In addition, it is helpful in the study planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend going to the company after studying, so that the job-hunting interview session can save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. Since the above said, I don't know your situation, so the introduction is only approximate and not detailed. If you have other things you want to consult, you can always contact me for communication and communication.
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), fireplace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, hood, lamp fittings, glass wiping, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who silently praised me. It's tiring to work hard to live but to continue
Life won't fail anyone who makes every effort. Just pay attention to me if you like, and thank those who silently compliment me
That's how life is. Others only see the results, support the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, but to continue. The way can be looked back, but it can't be looked back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of intent.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and the pay will pay off!
My day job
- Your request, my services.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the good.
The details that you care about, Fenggui Home Economics has helped you do "net" what I can, and serve the family.
Keep Wan's home clean, Tree Housekeeping Monument, Service in place, Clean to Home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if you don't clean it for a long time. You can only sparkle after cleaning, and so is life
Only by doing it with your heart can you succeed, and by using your meticulousness to mold exquisite, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me the opportunity and will definitely satisfy you, the quality speaks for itself, because the profession deserves to be trusted, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are not good!
But I always believe that as long as I take a serious attitude, persevere enough, and work hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining "!
The plan of the day lies in the morning, all the good things from the morning onwards I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and good intentions, and stay in a good mood all day long.
As a child, happiness is a thing, and it is happiness to have; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, and happiness is achieved; when you mature, you find that happiness is originally a state of mind, and you are happy when you comprehend it.
Be the truest and kindest self, walk with your heart, and have no regrets in this life; live one way, walk one's own path; live two treasures: good health, good mood, and live beautifully until old!
At every stage of life, different problems will be encountered.
Many times, it's not the ability that holds you back, it's the courage to face it positively.
Since it's impossible to avoid, it's better to face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
Secondly, although the rightists have a winning era in history, they are not long. So, it is short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink a little boiling water.
However, to be realistic, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the cultural revolution to define the truth standard, develop the economy and improve science and technology, and promote the administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be negated.
3. As far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he's serious, he's serious about China and he's serious about China's social problems.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that a revolution is anti-necessary. On the other hand, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of it.
4. Change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country's people. Those who attempt to extract chestnuts from the fire of political speculation are not rightists, but they are jerks.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's statements and analyze their thoughts when it needs to, so the left doesn't have this makeup, because what the left wants is exactly the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends rebutting the thief's left epilepsy while still moving really, and I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with the Chinese traitor and the left epilepsy. They are a sinus, and can't be reasoned.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone think about letting the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you five hair, when the left epilepsy scolds you right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also have ideals when they are teenagers. When they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, but become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually farther away, even the dragon-smuggling teenager ended up as a dragon.
I think that generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate gene from history and culture causes China as a whole to be left-leaning.
And the domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, and the left is strengthening supervision, paying more attention to fairness and security.
Now, the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to equity. At the same time, China and the United States are in contention. Left-leaning is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'm done with liking it
Don't say anything, the flowers are just.
In the past two years, the blockade and congestion of Huawei chips by Mei Emperor not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States Emperor suppressed China's chip industry, and demanded that its own enterprises and related enterprises of allied countries blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in lower R & D investment and reduced production capacity of chip-producing enterprises, thus creating a disorder of the shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
Nowadays, "core deficiency" has spread to major industries around the world, such as automobile companies shutting down production and mobile phone prices, and nearly all industries that use chips have been deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more countries' tech giants have begun to move to the path of "de-grooming".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and hamper the development of China's semiconductor industry, Lao America recently moved frequently and hosted the "Chip Summit"; it also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish the semiconductor alliance and provided funds to support the local technology giants of the United States. For example, Intel, the veteran technology giant of Metropolitan, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, spent $20 billion to build two crystal circle processing plants in Arizona, United States, and opened up the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to rob TSMC of its "job".
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States and the United States, has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large talent pool and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in a short period of time to defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongcou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongcou was surprising. For Intel's move to invest in building fabs, Zhang Zhongcou said bluntly without care: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongcou is disdainful to Intel's foray into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongcou is still deeply concerned about a feud between Intel and the power supply of the front desk for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the jewel in the manufacturing industry of U.S. Emperor, riding the top position in the world, and being the dominant player in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been mastered by a few strongmen.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chips were completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to testing. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred from facing huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongcou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and believed that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specially used for wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongcou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", and does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a small player in front of the Big Mac of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongcou approached Intel to invest. But at that time, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only doing manufacturing in the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was too high. He could not look after TSMC and decisively refused to invest in Taiwan's electricity accumulation.
Zhang Zhongcou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer process services at the time.
I didn't expect to look down on the giants of wafer manufacturing services, but now I'm going to start doing foundry for crystal wafers.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongcou found it ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization exceeds that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally does not dare to stand firm.
Today, TSMC has sprinted toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Today, take a look at some of the "strange hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February
They appear to be quite different from the "Evolution Model of Internet Public Opinion" once demonstrated by Netcom.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, and they showed [lone peaks], [jagged], and [broken cliffs].
[Lone Peak] That is, man-made heating, quickly burst into the hot seat and aroused the public's attention; [jagged] That is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic occupies the hot seat; [broken cliff] That is, collective evacuation, the hot seat has completed its "function", received a new task and dashed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event. The time varies from second to second. It must be that the unified batching army receives the task and starts a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot spots are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for the popularity, which fires the trend, which diverts attention, which affects perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion, which wraps up the decision-making. The black-produced accounts are batch-by-batch and node-by-node, and the battle is refined, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Leaving aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, black PR will also have nowhere to hide from the objective data only.
Anyone who walks past will leave traces, and such traces, we dig them out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning, there are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of IKEA, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to grow at a high rate.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly reach the eyeball. Compared to the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
Experts of Sisi Laboratory of China's Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Ophthalmologist of Beijing Union He Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions as a crowd.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the price of LCD TVs, at present, the price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually climbs.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small, with a small footprint.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Coupled with lower heat generation, less loss to the equipment, and longer service life of the TV.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring a more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
Talking about pseudo-needs, it's the product of demand subdivisions. On picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video and audio players. If you want to balance the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge it yourself, and you're afraid to listen to one side of the story.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle proximity projector -- laser TV -- has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the optimum design.
In order to block some of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structured Fresnel screen is costly, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflections to the eyes this is good when the selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, must be true LCD TV is also long "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it won't be like at all.
It is precisely ignored that the hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screen, a large amount of light reflected to the eyes at an angle, that is really uncomfortable.
Does the small umbrella buy insurance, rely on the chart?
The small umbrella is an insurance broker platform of the Internet.
From the point of view of set conditions: According to the "Regulation of Insurance Brokers Institutions (Revised in 2015)" prompt, those who become insurance brokers must meet three keywords: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, and the minimum amount is RMB50 million before they can be established, and they must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very demanding. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength. It should be approved by the national authority department of the Silver Insurance Regulatory Commission (which oversees insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and the shareholders should have a good style. As the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokers, the policyholder does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can achieve them.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star severe disease insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves and Thai Super Mary 5 Critical Disease Insurance, the claimants and insurers are and Thai Life, Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, and don't need to question its spectral dependence.
From the point of view of the payment model: the products of the Internet platform, because the operating expenses of the business network are less, and the cost of the salesman's wages, the Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the pressure of the policyholder's payment, while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professionalism requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will have a lot of misconceptions. In the health notification and occupation piece, non-insurance practitioners will often add their subjective awareness when insuring, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it. This is prone to many claims hidden dangers, and there is the risk of being rejected.
I myself did insurance phone sales in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (like a small umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I'm very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, and depends on it. What does not depend on it is people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 6 million yuan of insurance, 6 million yuan of insurance and mobile phones, and 60,000 free sickness insurance coverage. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are negligent, and they will not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is required to be charged according to the normal rate, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers withhold fees for a year or two to buy what they do not know.
Thought it could cost $1, and the insurance company would pay $6 million (pie in the world).
Free delivery of mobile phones, is the end of the policy number, such as 6666, 8888, this special policy segment only sent, and if the winning text message is sent, they do not redeem themselves, and nobody reminded.
(This is another pit for the policyholder.) It is short-term to receive the 60,000-fold disease coverage free of charge. If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial risk. In the event of a serious illness, 60,000 can do anything. You can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleadingness of Internet insurance sales.
So, on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and saving 2000-3000 yuan / year on premiums per person.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor the insurance products to the customer. In insuring, I will shop around for the customer, and try my best to obtain the best results of insurance for the customer. After insuring, I will do insurance policy finishing for the customer, and insurance policy hosting, so that the customer can be assured of no worries.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance process after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the insurance policy of the Internet insurance does not have much "ritual sense", it may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit like the general assembly line operation of "telephone sales", but there will be a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, and that is - subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether this "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can be with us for a long time and will also provide us with services after many years?
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we want to put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friends requests, and then made teasing posts, to the time you tried to post the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media, I've adopted a non-responsive attitude.
Afterwards, you intensified not only to continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook with impunity some obscure, humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, good health, what bed to grow strawberries, whether to insert or not, and other messages. I... also counted.
How do I know later that I received more than one friend sent about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and a sexual harassment comment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and it doesn't matter what status you are, in our society, it needs to be respected by both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your graph or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and shape.
I don't even think there's a girl who wants someone to humiliate themselves so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it OK?
I said good, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl will be able to say she's OK after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't have even basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice rests in the hearts of the people.
I've cut out some of the messages for you to comment on
There should be no one to impersonate the post you sent yourself, right

2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-Chinese Communist Party Media Multidimensional Report: The latest news on China-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China; the U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to the U.S. ally and enemy in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the news of the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform", a Chinese think tank, the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier was spotted by satellite near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Barabak Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with an F-35C fighter and a CMV-22 Osprey ship-borne transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising the Pacific Ocean.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan, is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Champlain Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stockdal".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) The U.S. and three aircraft carriers have assembled the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. Navy ship-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend in a rare visit.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The rare visit to Guam by the US and three aircraft carriers amassing the most powerful weapons around China said that it was a signal to the allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military installations in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshan Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomersubmarine".
The movements of 14 "thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding the ballistic missile submarines have made the "thunderbolt submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes launch-well ballistic missiles located in the continental United States, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads, such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent meta plunge of 26%, and the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today are themselves traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on are Meta's traffic channels, no matter what functional positioning.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps externalize Meta's advertising. Through Meta's advertising platform, it is possible to realize cash.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google takes another shot, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that make maritime businesses.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several large agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets. Meta is a bypass advertising channel, and most of the money burned goes to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can earn a lot of money from bytes in the last two years.
Domestic agents are helping Meta to advertise there, and Meta's performance in Greater China is very good.
I haven't specifically understood it recently, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of the new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, how it expects in the future.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metaverse's realization cycle is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So these next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's very scenery right now. It also has $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue every year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet businesses and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life, and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has little confidence, and between disruption is the blink of an eye.
And the unattainable concept of engaging in the metaverse has absolutely no prospect of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous. That is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name again, and it is the fundamental reason for constantly searching for a new track. However, I think his track choice is wrong. It is a path of no return above which is some of my thinking for reference.
