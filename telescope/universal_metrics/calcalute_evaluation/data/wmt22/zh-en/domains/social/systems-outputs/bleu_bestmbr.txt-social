Let me start with the conclusion, I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spot, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that Making you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching it. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel. It is indescribable, and there are many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it is a piece of shit.
First let me briefly talk about some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The male lead should live on a small island in the south, and he lives with his grandma.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to watch the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the hostess and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters from the party on the island easily seal a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road parked on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why did a gangster with bad credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police, the police in the movie asked whether there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sits outside the room door to sleep for the night?
These sort of inexplicable plot points exist throughout the film, and are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, just this monstrous stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, and after a little more than 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway throughLarge-Martin, you think it might be a drama that demonstrates the difficulty of survival in a small town. After watching it, you don't have any idea what you are watching, but what follows is a deep suspicion of yourself, why go to the cinema to enjoy the dirty stool after watching it during a new year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspiration + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie goes to success step by step.
If you want to make a romance, then you should honestly talk about the grudges between the young man in the small town who likes to ride motorcycles and the girl who waits.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot have anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character Yin Zheng played in that his new motorcycle was burned, and then he could sing), he couldn't read some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the heroine who is clearly not mentally retarded, but acts like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to acting skills or the director's request.
Another thing that I can't understand, as a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add to the audience?
Thanks to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been given away!

I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I cannot stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice.
Not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive ligand will be more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of "starter" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, hard balls can’t withstand, and it is difficult for athletes to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is- tennis is so difficult, we know that you can't learn it, and you know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones to fool you. If you play twice, you will not play again, so this racquet is cheap and you will not feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets can’t sell for the price. New ones will be good at 500, 600. Second-hand ones will be 200, and will it be good to own a thousand yuan racket?
Very friendly to novices, but it's tasteless once past the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What's hot in 2021?
Definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was a very popular article "Look! Olympic Projects that Project Managers Can Hit With Gold Medals". It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead on many projects, and no one can do it. Moving bricks, traveling, and staying up late are the day-to-day activities of project managers, and even don't speak of聆sting, carrying the blame, and making apology.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also reveals the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project management.
Those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China's Project Management Development Report in the Twenty Years (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the country has accumulated nearly 600,000 candidates for PMP®, about 420,000 people passed PMP® certification, and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which means that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" in the past. The ever-changing work environment has taught us that we have to learn to explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does the PMP test ensure smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really implement project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, making no project management theory and not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, inability to implement at work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and procrastination on projects; unclear division of labor among members, and the dead-sticks in the team don't know how to deal cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, so the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding companies to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers and has obtained the honorary title of "China-based Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" with the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
Online Course of R&D Project Manager Special Training Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower cost and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
Words have no evidence, you can first look at what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei R&D and management team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help students convert and apply the learning content to specific work after class.
It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District!
This car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget about it, I don't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that your myvi will reach 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching it wherever you go, so I’m very uncomfortable! (Actually, it’s a bit cool)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you will not climb out of the car and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and immediately deaf after you get out of the car. (But still very cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door is opened!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (what the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, please contact us!
For more car information you don't know, in The Car Guide / People's Auto Record
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe all car owners will know, Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also millions!
That day, foreign countries crashed millions of sports car 911 and 10 million supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it is justified!
When NFT was out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to "Honor of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" brings a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. Besides having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I read a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest impression is the company's choice on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, choose the industry that has good growth in the future, and consider the industry with best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry that has policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are "do the things right", which is to do things right.
strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether to continuously deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking). For example, on improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct campaign goals such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers. On enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency of a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after discussing the details of the purchase of the plant with Mr. Lin, a family member of the house owner, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan via bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Building Sales Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be designated to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
He finally picked the house, the deposit was paid, and the house price was ready, so it was only after the “close call” to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
Following trial, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed on the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied to this case, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability for double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer reminder] You must exercise the necessary prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should do the necessary prudence and care, for example, verify the house owner’s information, whether the house is occupied or not, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.

Accidentally read the following article, discusses why this customer asks a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, from the perspective of commercial and shelf life. Although canning is deep processing and not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text here may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and have contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is better.
There are also consumers who respond after eating out of this mentality that the taste or taste of the cans is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why the canget is expensive. Where is the price?
Why is the price difference so big for the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising dollars every year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: salesman in shopping malls, display fees at shopping malls, gift fees of products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and are canned, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, unscrupulously linked with doctors in hospitals, and they assist in product promotion, and they get a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow this method of operation. In fact, this practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise that you have a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing properties of the milk powder, which has no impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans and bags after opening is the same, it is just that the bags are not easy to keep after opening and are susceptible to moisture deterioration.
I just saw an article about menstruation, it was too long.
science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will come regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will roll over in bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
The menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary pad or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period starts, before there is time to have dysmenorrhea, can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but it is useless to take it after the dysmenocorder begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, the period will basically have a period within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it will easily breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, and if you add pre-prepared shipments, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify it here, the tampon does not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal problems during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation period will also be unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is unfortunate, and the body will make mistakes for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as excuses.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually gets thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is the house, and a house is built every month (stemmed lining) to be ready to welcome guests. When guests do not come, they are all demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day several days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and the preparations that women's body makes to conceive life are disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up, stop thinking this way, the men who have never experienced it, will not experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and don't know what, how do you face your mother, you want your children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it really works.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from "Book of Changes:Xi Xian Shang" "the metaphysics is called Tao, and the metaphysical is called implement", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from the metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not say a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judging various moral views, and giving moral guidelines for the right or wrong behavior.
It studies what patterns of moral conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live, and summarizing observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the presumed theory, but investigates real choices made and observed by actual moral agents (moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to these decisions, and it examines the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, particularly the assistance that has not been interrupted since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994.
Now, the old parents of most of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and got married.
It was your act of righteousness that helped us as families in distress through the most difficult time.
The new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to our distressed family -- the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief campaign should have come to a close.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the Independencia Federation of Int'l America (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the IFCA and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

The relief funds are often not delivered to the victims of the June 4th incident.
In 1994, following the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans' Relief Fund for Two Orphans in Special Hardship", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects mainly comes from the campus and social donations from June Fourth, generous donations from individuals, and the support of the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
Only last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the families of victims of the June Fourth finally received a part of the donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June Fourth donation for the consideration of the donors. We are indeed some retired old people and our income is not as rich as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to “friends.”
We will respect the decision of our families to terminate the program within two years and resume immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous compatriots who have continued to give generously and risked humanitarian aid over the years.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don’t have such an idea, it is best to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before you select an training institution, it is better to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from a major in computer science, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Many offline and online training institutions are actually good now, but firstly the cost of learning is high, and the second is more time investment, so you basically need 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources in Station B. If you are unable to find resources, you can also contact me through the presentation to get free resources, or give detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the learning will not be very laborious, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be someone to answer questions庞大 handy, and also you can assist in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referrals, and recommend to the company after study, so that later on, the interview process for job hunting can save a lot of trouble.
The above are some of my opinions, because I don't know your situation, I only give a general introduction and not detailed information. If you have anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently praised me, work hard for life, life is very tiring but continue
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, follow me if you like it, and thank those who silently praise me
Life is like this, others only look at the results and support the process by yourself. In the face of life, we have no choice but to continue to be strong. We can look back, but we cannot walk back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of attentiveness.
Although we do the most dirty work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of customers, all the hard work in that moment is worth it, and the tribute will eventually pay off!
my daily work
- Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping helps you to "clean" what I can and serve the loving family.
Keep thousands of homes clean, build household monuments, service in place, and clean your home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine, and so is life
To do it with heart can be successful, to shape a delicate with meticulousness, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me a chance, you will be satisfied. Quality means everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
All walks of life are not good right now!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!”
The plan of a day is in the morning, all the good things start in the morning. I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health and success, and keep in a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, it means happiness if you possessed it; when you grew up, happiness is a goal, and you can achieve them; when you mature, you realize that happiness is a state of mind, and happiness is all understanding.
To be the truest and kindest self; to walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; walk one road in life, to take your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and a beautiful old life!
At every stage of life, there are different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to them, the problem will be solved.
2. Although the rightists have had a period of success in history, it was not long, so short because a little sunshine makes you bright, and a little water produces sweat; as soon as you splurge too, you will be able to prosper in Longwangshu, and if you are attacked, you will have nothing to do.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspect of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I dont completely agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about him, and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I think anti-necessary revolution. A revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to the people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries will take advantage of them.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who attempt to make amends by political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right’s words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have this fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who refuted the anti-thief and left-handedness, and they were really angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the Zuoan, they are just filthy and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove us right, let alone let the rebels and left idiots admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the rebels call you fifty cents, and when the left man calls you right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal is moving away, and even the dragon slayer eventually turns into a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China should be a left-leaning whole due to the innate genes of history and culture.
Currently the domestic right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Right now, society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the conflict between China and the US will be split to the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Huahua is so loyal
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" companies.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies of allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, lowering R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers and causing a disorder in the global chip supply chain.
Today, the "lack of chips" has spread to major industries around the world. For example, car companies have stopped production and mobile phone prices have risen. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered severely.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", more and more technology giants in countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control power and contain the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the old US has recently been making frequent moves, hosting the “chip summit”, and inviting giants of 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance and funding local technology giants in America. For example, American imperialist old technology giant Intel, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, spent US $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States and open the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and it will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising response. Regarding Intel's move to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said without hesitation: Intel is building a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the high-end semiconductor chips in the world had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
With the market demand, in the 1980s, the chip industry began to see division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously too self-centered and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then have to start wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic that Intel entered the foundry.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Happy Dragon, the rate increase of Orion, the steal of goods, and the spread of public opinion to form a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak], [jag shape], and [cliff shape].
[Lone Peak] is artificial heating, quickly rushes to the list of hot searches, attracting public attention; [Jagged] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list; [Prevalence] is a mass withdrawal, and the hot search has used its “function”, received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, the time is not inappropriate, so it must have been a unified batch of naval forces who received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which is in charge of popularizing, which diverts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion and which coerces decision-making, and black accounts are inocks in batches and nodes and fine-tuned operations, taking almost all factors in the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
All walks will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and ophthalmologist of Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
With more and more attention to eye health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the prices of laser TVs currently available on the market are more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually climbed.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
Definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It’s not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing it, you can judge for yourself because you are afraid to hear one side’s word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle close focus projector - laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a microscopic Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection vendors use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. You diffuse reflection on the ceiling, and you cannot see it. If you insist on being more realistic, LCD TVs also emit "", so when you turn on the TV, won't the ceiling also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be an image at all.
Just the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain curtain is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the viewpoint of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage firm, three key words must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major violation record in the last 3 years, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually harsh, they all involve having abilities, in order to be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good manner. As a small umbrella insurance of an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to ask too much into question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds that not all insurance companies can establish.
At this point, it is not bad and is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many company’s star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claimant and the insurer are Hetai Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment mode: Internet platform products discount the operation costs of operating outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of insurance policyholders, and at the same time maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the professionalism point of view of clerks: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can apply for insurance themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or fit, so that there are many hidden dangers in claims and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done telephone sales of insurance on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible for here.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, receive 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid major issues. They will not tell the policyholder that the first month 1 yuan and the next month, you need to pay a unchanged fee, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct the fee for a year or two and they are unclear what they paid for.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent from the special policy number segment of the policy tail number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be converted by科学研究 and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The 60,000 critical illness insurance value for free is short-term. If you rely only on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of a serious illness, what can you do, and can not solve the problem, your life in the future will start to run away.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So in general, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should comprehensively consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and each person saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker who has 3 years experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly one thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing an insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance placement, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will organize insurance policies for customers and manage褶 them so that customers can feel at ease.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the Internet insurance does not have a very “ceremony”, it may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line of "telephone sales", but there is a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, which is-the follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When we are buying insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can stay with us for a long time and provide us with services after many years?
From the past to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such acts of personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must stop this villain.
If you ignore political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style of work.
To the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to teasing posts, to your attempt to put my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but you continued discouraging with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, shape, good childbirth, and somewhile other messages such as how to plant strawberries in bed, and whether or not to intervene.
How can I know that later, I even received multiple messages from friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend account and remarks with sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't be silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes,you can continue to be ridiculed and obscure,humiliating, abusive, you can continue to say that you just love and follow me,you can continue to think this it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny it is not your drawing or continue to make any offensive statement.
Yes, I cannot, and have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is a girl who would be so shamed in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut off part of the message for you to comment
No one can pretend to be you in your own posts
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization

The Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Multi-dimensional reports by pro-CCP media: the latest news on Sino-US relations:The latest satellite imagery shows that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US轴承 media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the US aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean include the USS Abraham Abraham (USS Abraham Lincoln) which departed from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
The three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers were massing around China.

(Weibo@南海Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China on a rare visit to Guam, an analysis said, which is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," which also includes siloed ballistic missiles in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent Meta plunge of 26%, wiping away $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he is "facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps add ads from Meta, and realize monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs it again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about several hundred people in the Hong Kong office, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte’s TT is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it certainly won't be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, what is the future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don’t look at the beauty of Facebook now, it also has an annual revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion. In fact, Facebook is very sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.工件.
回家 Although several of his social software have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is also the blink of an eye.
This elusive concept of the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is changing the company’s name and is also constantly looking for new tracks.感到几家 其中， However, I think his choice of track was wrong, and it is a point of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
