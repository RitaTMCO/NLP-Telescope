Let's start with the conclusion. I personally think that "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether this movie has no highlights or not, it's not that at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies. The one that allows you to fall asleep soundly in the cinema is one kind, and the one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching it is also one kind. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Gram novel, indescribable, and the loopholes are like the windbreaker on the little brother.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then she arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
The elderly are watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van? ？
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then the old man didn't follow.
How did the heroine and his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the speed party punks on the island easily seal a section of mountain road? ？
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck drivers could not be found around.
This sense of props is too obvious.
Why would a punk speed party with bad credit reporting and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room to sleep overnight?
This kind of inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's even worse is the main thrust of the movie, or that the movie has no main thrust at all, it is an abomination stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you would guess that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you thought it might be a feature film that wanted to reflect the hardships of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't know what you watched at all. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the movie in the new Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie has succeeded step by step. .
If you want to make a love movie, then you should honestly talk about the grievances and entanglements between the young people in the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot appear contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng whose new motorcycle was just burned down and then he could still sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that he couldn't even bear to see.
As for the heroine, she is obviously not mentally retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
One more thing I can't understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen to add a crash plot to his own movie?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival schedule to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive beat will normally be more friendly than the cheap beat. This kind of “entry-level beat” is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand it, and it is difficult for the masters to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult. I know you can't learn it. I also know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones. Make a bargain to fool you. If you play twice, you won't play again. This beat is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. Come to me to buy expensive ones when the time comes, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price and buy a better second-hand racket. Choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets can't sell for the price. The new racket is 500 or 600. It's good. The second-hand one is 200 yuan. Isn't it good to have a thousand yuan shot?
It is very friendly to novices, but it is tasteless as soon as it passes the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Projects where Project managers can Impact Gold Medals" is very popular. It is mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match it: moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers. Fighting fires, carrying pots, and apologizing are even more of a cinch.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the powerlessness of the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work have gradually chosen to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the rising number of applicants for PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants across the country is nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed the PMP® certification is about 420,000, and the number of valid holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® licenses.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the “old experience” of the past. The rapidly changing working environment allows us to know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the project management work be guaranteed to be unimpeded after taking the PMP exam?
Many beginners in project management say that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land at work, project estimation is inaccurate, poor control sensitivity, and the project is delayed; the division of labor of members is not clear, and the “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance. Communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance. ……

It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of a supercar in the new mountain area!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit, and the four-wheel drive is called LP700. Why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. It's probably when Xiaobian's myvi reaches 30km/h, people will reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching wherever they go, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
You have to practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The sound of the engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the car. (But it's still cool)
The body is too large, and it will be very narrow to park in an ordinary parking space. I am afraid that I will be knocked on when the next car opens the door!
It's a bit lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that drivers all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercar in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
When NFT quickly emerged from the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on Blockchain technology. It combines a variety of gameplay methods, including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds US 88.2 million, which is directly ahead of "Glory of the King".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of “Axie Infinity” has passed on a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of Blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by Blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the company in the future, which refers to the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with a lot of room for growth, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, we must choose an industry with good future growth, and consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, we must choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to “do the things right”, that is, to do things right.
The strategy lies in “doing the right thing”, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on improving the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as legal tender. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, and the cryptocurrency investment exposure has expanded again.
From the perspective of Blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang, from a real estate agent. After many on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu consulted with Lin Mou, the family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory building, he remitted 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the “Receipt of Deposit for the Sale and Purchase of the Factory Building", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The two parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale and purchase of the factory building within one week. ”
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale and purchase of the house.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house that I finally fancy, the deposit has been paid, and the payment for the house is ready, so I just signed the contract “one step at a time", but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract in the end cannot be attributed only to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the double return of the deposit for breach of contract liability.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer reminder] In the transaction process, we must fulfill the necessary obligations of prudence and attention.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must fulfill the necessary obligations of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other related information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is the second week you moved to Japan.
You walk down the street and suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear, and finally run away.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait! ”(Full Japanese dialogue) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
“Miss... I am a director. I think you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show? ”
You are very puzzled, afraid that this is a scam.
He stuffed you with a business card, and you found out that he is really the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
“If the lady has time, we can go to the company to talk, and the salary must be indispensable. ”
You came to the company with him in a daze. He said that he saw you on the street at a glance and very much hoped that you would come to participate.
Thinking that you have nothing to lose and can still make money, you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale love reality show, divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and amateurs will get along in real life and cultivate a tacit understanding.
In the later stage, you will enter the game to pass the level together.
The official recording will start next week. You don't know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
I accidentally saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the shelf life, I talked about why this customer wants the logistics company in the free trade zone to help with canning. Although canning belongs to deep processing, it does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder and the bagged milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of listening packs is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive ones are the good ones.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the listening device is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why listening is expensive, where is it expensive?
Their raw materials are the same, why is the difference so large?
Because when manufacturers price, most of them take into account that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening equipment to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening, not bagging.
Also, you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising dollars every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotion staff of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the cost of product gifts, and the cost of advertising, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and the price of listening to the installation is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, do whatever it takes to hook up with doctors in the hospital, and they will assist in the promotion of the products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from the first listen.
However, China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this approach is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bags of milk powder and put it in cans under the premise that they have cans at home. This can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which will not have any effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than that of the bag. If the listening package has the same shelf life as the bag after the package is opened, it is just that the bag is not easy to store after the package is opened, and it is susceptible to moisture and deterioration.
I just saw an article about holidays, it's too long.
Let's popularize science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first regular vacation on a certain day during the age of 13-15, and they will have amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be accurately predicted. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes bad luck will overturn the car (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people shed less, and some people have a lot of blood; some people have no response, and some people are so painful that they are transported away by ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. Not painful before does not mean that it will not be painful for a lifetime.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds for 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking Brofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period before it has time to have dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take it after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you have diarrhea around the time of the cycle, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced every two or three hours, otherwise they are easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. In the worst case, they are replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not every month. Use one piece.
(Modify it here, you don't have to change the tampons often, you can change them once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal disturbances during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation may also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body stumbles on itself.
However, the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed endometrium.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and then it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, they will all be demolished (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds 24 hours a day for a few days a month, and there will be abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruated. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that the preparation behavior of the female body for giving birth to life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it before and will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude mean to face one's own mother, how can one mean to want one's own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "metaphysics“ is taken from the phrase ”The metaphysical is called the way, the metaphysical is called the instrument" in the "Book of Changes". It was translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji Period) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, and it is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method naturalism refers to the research method that ignores the word God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two most important schools of thought in discussing the “relationship between mind and body”.
Knowledge theory is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and studies human moral life; here, ethics is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (the evaluation of various moral concepts, and the suggestion of moral norms for correct or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of ethical code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent (moral agent), all the moral factors that contributed to this decision, and it examines the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and Medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vara, Montaigne and others.
The second part: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli et al., modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empiricist ethics, representative: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative: Bentham and Sikivik et al., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer and Huxley et al., late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kai'er et al., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (non-rationalist ethics, representatives: Kerkegaer, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies “the principles and standards of effective inference and proof”.
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, traceable reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline with the theme of the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in my personal name in early 1994, the assistance has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up into families.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped us families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have also retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend humanitarian donations to our difficult-Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end a long time ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the National Federation of Students (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian assistance, the National Federation of Students and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often intersect.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the people who are difficult to reach on June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the “Tiananmen Mothers” to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Orphan Special Hardship Fund for the Elderly", which has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and were supported by the Foundation for Democracy of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the members of the June 4th Family finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of June 4th that year.
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of donations on June 4th is for the consideration of donors. We are indeed all retirees. Our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I hereby express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his “To Friends” letter.
We will respect the decision of the difficult members, terminate this project within two years, and resume immediately when needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have insisted on giving generously for many years and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian relief funds.
A programming white who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have any ideas in this area, it's best to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, it depends on the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, the faculty strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, check out this training institution. It is best to check out the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because you haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will have something to do with the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one is the high cost of learning, and the other is the investment of more time, and the basic need is to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situation I'm talking about, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are also many training resources at Station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or a detailed consultation is fine.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that the study does not have to be very strenuous, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, and some people have special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion places, and recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview process of looking for a job can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. Because I don't understand your situation, I will only introduce it in general and not in detail. If you have anything else you want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
In person, undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted furnaces, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping services
Thank you to those who silently praised me. I'm tired of working hard for life, but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard. If you like it, follow me. Thank you to those who like me silently.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, and they support the process by themselves. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back but we can't go back.……
Cleaning is work and duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue at that moment is worth it, and the effort will eventually be rewarded!
My daily work
——Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep the beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping has helped you do my best to “clean” and serve your family.
Keep the Wanjia clean, build a monument to the housekeeping, the service is in place, and the home is clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it be overflowing with brilliance, and the same is true in life.
Only by doing it with your heart can you succeed, and we are serious about shaping exquisite and beautiful seams with meticulous care.
Give me the opportunity and I will definitely satisfy you. The quality says everything, because the profession is worthy of being trusted, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
All walks of life are not easy to do at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent enough, and hard enough, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining.”!
The plan of the day lies in the morning. All the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishful thinking, and maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I found that happiness turned out to be a state of mind, and happiness when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is one way in life, go your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and live beautifully until you get old!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you meet difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
2. Although the right has had an era of ambition in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is bright when you give a little sunshine, and sweaty when you drink a little boiling water; if you get a little ambition, you will be happy, and if you are hit, you will be attached to it.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social issues seriously. Take it seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-communist revolution is necessary. Revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's livelihood, and political groups are mixed with fish and dragons. Then foreign countries take advantage of the void to enter.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make political speculation shudder are not rightists, but bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
Zuo, in fact, is a group of outcast children of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing remarks and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this kind of creation, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while fighting against the thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with traitors and Zuo Lunatics. They are all the same, and they are unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and Zuo Fan admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti-thief scolds you for fifty cents, and when the left crazy scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but become paranoid.
Gradually drifting away from the ideal, even the dragon slayer boy eventually became a dragon.
I think the left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes from history and culture cause China as a whole to be left-leaning.
The domestic right is liberal and pays attention to efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Now society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are fighting each other. The left is certain, and it is estimated that it will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's over if I like it.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US emperor has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “American” companies to suffer huge losses.
The U.S. emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies in allied countries to blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , Resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chain disorders.
Nowadays, the ”lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the price increase of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of “chips”, technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move towards the road of “de-beautification”.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old United States has recently taken frequent actions and hosted the “Chip Summit”; it also invited 64 giants to form a semiconductor alliance and drew funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant in the United States, spent US220 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, it was very likely to take away TSMC's “rice bowl”.
The reason for this certainty is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, regarding Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the “2021 Masters Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly. Regarding Intel's move to build a FAB, Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples and said bluntly: Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still brooding about a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and is the world's overlord in the semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to packaging and testing. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then it is possible to set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of “wafer processing”, does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obvious that some people regarded TSMC too highly and looked down on TSMC. Decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at the time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now also going to start foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
Facing TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Huolala incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They look exactly the same as the [Online Public Opinion Evolution Model] once displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak-like], [jagged], and [cliff-like].
[Lone peak shape] That is, artificial heating, quickly rushes to the hot search, attracting public attention; [jagged shape] that is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff shape] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search completes the “function”, receives a new task, and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event happens to be the trough of another event. The time is not bad in minutes and seconds. It must be a unified group of naval forces that received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, and which blackmail decision-making. The black-produced accounts are refined into battles in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we walk, we will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between LASER TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points：
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the fully rolled out market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TVs shipped and sold worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation to the eyes is smaller.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and ophthalmologists of Beijing Union Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparative tests of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, most of the current prices of commercially available laser TVs are above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price has gradually risen.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is compact and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. There are pros and cons to everything. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself. I'm afraid I'll listen to one-sided words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screens is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point is that I especially hate projection manufacturers to use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, you can't see it. If you have to be more serious, LCD TVs are also diffuse "direct light”. Isn't the CEILING illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen that is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
Judging from the setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three conditions must be met: shareholders and sponsors have no major illegal records in the last three years, and the minimum amount is RMB 50 million before it can be established, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding. In summary, they must be strong, approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good style of work. As a small umbrella insurance for an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds that not all insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical illness insurance is on the shelves. The claimant and the underwriting party are both Hetai Life. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, the price ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payment, reduces the pressure on policyholders to pay, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the businessperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can insure their own insurance. There will be many misunderstandings in this way. In terms of health and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or in line, so it is easy to have many hidden dangers of claims, and there may be a risk of being refused compensation.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in ”Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Xiaoyu Umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I tell you very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and will not tell the policyholder. The first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is subject to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for one or two years. It is unclear what they bought.
Thinking that it could cost 1 yuan, the insurance company paid 6 million (the world lost the pie).
The free mobile phone is given only for special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888 with the tail number of the policy, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the policyholder.) Receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free is short-term. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of a serious illness, 60,000 yuan will not solve the problem, and you will start to run naked in your future life.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So overall, there is no problem with the platform and no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject carefully consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers can choose from more opportunities and products. The price/performance ratio of some products is also better than that of Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and each person saves 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in business management training, has served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs and tailor insurance products for customers. During the insurance process, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After applying for insurance, I will organize and manage the policies for customers, so that customers can rest assured. Worry-free.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a “sense of ceremony”, and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, that is, follow-up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can stay with us for a long time and will provide us with services in many years?
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just have to put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, and then published ridiculing posts, to the time you tried to post the so-called location of my home and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
In the future, you will intensify your efforts not only to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to brazenly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some vague and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, figure, good health, and what kind of bed to grow strawberries, do you want to insert such messages, I. . . Forget it.
How do you know that later, I received a number of friends about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing remarks on your Facebook friend account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer be silent.
After the news of my call to the police was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridicule, obscenity, humiliation, and abuse. You can also continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not a picture made by you or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there will be any girl who is willing to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say that she is okay after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic morals will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is at ease in people's hearts.
I cut off part of the message for everyone to comment
No one should be able to pretend to be you in the posts you posted by yourself, right?
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization

The three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China. Rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media Multidimensional report: Latest news on Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform”, on January 9, the satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will go to the South China Sea for deployment.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier ”Carl Vinson“ has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 ”Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the “Carl Vinson”, the U.S. aircraft carrier that is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, there is also the “USS Abraham Lincoln” (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" was also equipped with an F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser "Lake Champlain“ and the guided missile destroyer ”Stockdale".
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the ”South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said this was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratlys in recent years.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer submarines" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of the 14 “thunder submarines” in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines have made the ”Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity”" This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers that can carry nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the market capitalization of 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that he is "facing unprecedented competition." What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Nowadays, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook Inst Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance”. Many apps are external to Meta's advertisements, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google takes another stab next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and there are also several major agents in the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Bytedance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from Bytedance in the first two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically understood it recently, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going well.
Facebook is getting older and older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the “Meta universe”.
Meta universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current very beautiful scenery. It also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and it is a blink of an eye between subversions.
And the unattainable concept of engaging in the Meta universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name again and kept looking for new tracks. The root reason, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
