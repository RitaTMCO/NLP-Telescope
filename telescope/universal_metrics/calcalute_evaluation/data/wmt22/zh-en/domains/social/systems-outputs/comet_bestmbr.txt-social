Let me start with the conclusion. I personally think "The Four Seas" is a lousy film in all aspects, in every sense.
But if you're saying that there aren't any bright spots in the film, at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad films, one makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and another makes you feel indignant after watching. To the audience, "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han really is exceptionally talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a computer novel, it is indescribable and has many loopholes like the windbreaker on Brother Ma.
After watching it, you will wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think more about it, it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly describe some of the situations that I find it hard to understand.
The protagonist resides in a small island in the south, and lives with his grandma.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow and then arrange for an uncle in her neighborhood to drive her to the north-east to see the snow in a minivan.
Senior people watch the snow from South to Northeast in a van
He and his father were extremely reassured about this.
Then this old man just stopped talking.
How did his brother-in-law get a business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the motorcycle punks on the island block off a stretch of mountain road so quickly??
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver of the truck could not be found anywhere all around.
The use of this prop is just too obvious.
Why would a young scoundrel who has insufficient credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not report to the police when facing loan sharks, the cop in the film also specifically asked whether there was a problem?
How can an adult know how to use a smartphone yet not know how to open the door with the key card at the hotel, then forcefully arrange for the owner to sit outside the door of the room to sleep all night?
There are such inexplicable episodes that pervade the film and are so outrageous that it becomes painful for me to remember them.
In addition to the plot, what’s even worse is the movie’s theme, or relatively nothing at all, that of a detestable-looking seamstress.
At the beginning of the film, you think that he wants to make a comedy, but after approximately 20 minutes you suspect it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through you think it might be a年底
For most people, it is very familiar with the rhetoric of various types of films. For example, if you want to film a motorcycle rider, just use inspirational and comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie can become successful step by step.
If you want to make romance movies, then you need to be honest about tensions between a young guy in a small town who likes to ride motorcycles, and a woman who is a waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot must not contain anything that is inconsistent with the normal world.
(Like the character promoted by Yin Zheng whose new motorcycle had just been burned, and is still able to sing), it is impossible to generate brain holes that even Kennedy couldn’t separate himself from.
As for the heroine who is obviously not retarded but acts like a 5-year-old kid in some aspects, I don't know if this is because of her acting skills or the director's request.
There is another point I don't understand, why Han Han is so inclined to include crash examples in his own films as a race car driver?
Is it aimed at creating congestion for viewers when such a movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival?
Thanks to all of today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given out!

I want to try tennis, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep going, so I want to find a trainer at a similar price first.
Unfriendly. In fact, prices are usually proportional to the friendliness, and if they cannot be distinguished, the normal case is the expensive ones are more friendly than the cheap ones. This type of "entry camera" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is so big that a hard ball could not stand up, making it difficult to handle even for advanced players.
The logic and subtext of their existence is—Tennis is so hard. If you know that you can’t learn it, you may not be willing to buy expensive stuff. To fool you by making cheap things, if you play twice, you wouldn’t play again.
When you really can tell what is good from bad, it means you have made progress. Then I will buy expensive products and I will earn twice the money.
It is suggested to spend a similar price to play a better second-hand racket, and choose from Prince or Dunlop. The two brands don’t have much reputation, and good rackets are not sold for high prices. New ones will cost just 500 or 600 yuan, and used ones are 200 yuan.
It seems friendly for novices, but becomes useless once past the newbie stage. But most people, especially girls, won’t make it past the novices stage.

What will be the hottest stuff in 2021?
It is without a doubt the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, a very popular political article wrote "Look! project managers can match gold medals for Olympic events". It mentioned that project managers could follow the lead in several projects.
This seemingly joking article also shows the daily bitterness of project managers, which reflects their inability to cope with the current project management.
Those engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to use some actions to extricate themselves from the predicaments in the workplace.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to enhance their project management capabilities.
According to the “20 Years Development Report of Project Management China (1999-2019)”, as of September 2019, there had been nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants across China, 420,000 people who passed the PMP® certification, and approximately 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the worldwide total.
In the past ten years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which means that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience". The changing working environment gave us the ability to learn and explore the way forward on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can the PMP test be enough to guarantee the smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners reported that they could systematically master the ten major areas and five process groups in project management through learning PMP/IPMP and other relevant courses, but there was still confusion when it came to actually doing project management.
Many project executives often report the following problems: Lack of project management understanding and independent experience, not knowing how to put the project management theory into practice; lack of a systematic role in project management procedures and systems, inability to enable implementation during work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delays in projects;
So, with more than ten years of focus on product innovation and R&D management, CNTIC has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers.
“R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp” is an online course of fragmented learning which combines practical cases, tools and methods from many R&D companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard activities of project managers and embark on an advanced project management path.
This is also an opportunity for companies to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results for enterprises.
You can see what the other students say about this course first. This course is explained in simple terms by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei research and development management team), combining the international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies.
In addition, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform and apply learned content to specific work after class.
It's known as the largest exhaust noise from supercars in New Mountain Area!
This car brought to you by our team is the dream of many people!
This is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement for Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM23 million, the yearly road tax is more than 1000RMB, and it has 4 wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Since it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, so it seems like my myvi just gets to 30km/h when others reach 100km/h. Well.
Low body, glass front doors, large air intakes all around the body and 6.5 V12 engine clearly seen under the glass are the perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It is too much attention, everybody is watching wherever I go, and I am very uncomfortable! (Actually, it is cool)
Gas cost is around RM1 per 1km (the owner does not care at all)
Getting in and out of the car requires some practice, otherwise it will be awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway)
The engine noise is so loud that I'll go deaf immediately after getting off the car. (It's still cool, though)
The vehicle is too big, so it is very narrow to park in a normal parking space, and I am afraid that a car next door will knock on it when the door is opened!
I am a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I say it myself, it has nothing to do with the owner of the car, haha)
Don’t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is NOT for sale, sorry!
Anyone who wants to shoot a video for their car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information that you don't know about, you can find it in The Car Guide / People's Auto Magazine
Involved in accident worth thousands of dollars
I believe all drivers all know about Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911, Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world and Porsche 911 is also worth over a million dollars!
A few days ago, a million 911 sports cars and 10 million Chiron supercars were knocked down in a few minutes in the same country!
Looking at the results, this is justified!
At a time when NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic started to earn steady income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology. It integrates multiple gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction value, having exceeded US$3 billion so far.
Data from TokenTerminal shows that Axie Infinity’s daily operating income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to that of “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
With the use of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player. Apart from having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game and its ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
First I got an industry that has much room to grow, at least a market size of RMB 100 billion; secondly, I have to choose注意 future growth industries, and consider the sectors where the growth will be at its best after 3-5 years; finally, we should choose the industries that have policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of industry development, and whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to “do the things right,” which means just doing things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing what's the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, while tactics are in implementation. There is room for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it can be considered when deepening in the current field
Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021 after 12 years of its existence.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated bitcoin as legal tender. This is the first time bitcoin has become the legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, SEC approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it in the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to enter the United States capital market, expanding cryptocurrency investment exposure once again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin isn't the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agency about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of purchasing the factory building with a family member of the owner, Lin, and remitted 200,000 yuan via bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
It is stated that "If the purchaser wants to purchase the plant, the deposit will come back to the seller; if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two sides agree to sign an agreement on the construction of the plant within one week."
However, the two parties have failed to reach consensus on major contract terms, such as the scope of plant sales and mode of payment. This resulted in a delay in signing the property sale contract.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally paying a deposit and ready to fully purchase the house, I was just about to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell it, which caused Mr. Lu to be helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu brought a suit against Lin to the Yuyao City People’s Court.
After hearing the hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and the responsibility could not be attributed to the defendant alone.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Attorneys remind】 The customer must exercise the necessary duty of prudence and care in the process of transaction.
When signing a contract, buyers must perform the required prudential obligations, such as verifying information about the property owners, whether the property is occupied or not, and specifying the date and place of delivery in the contract, to prevent any disputes during contract performance.
Your name is Zheng Mian and this is the second week you moved to Japan
You are walking on the street, suddenly you realize that someone is following you, you step faster and faster in fear, and eventually run.
The man chased after you: “Miss! Please wait!” (full conversation in Japanese) You stopped just in front of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director and I see you are really beautiful, are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are confused and are afraid that this is a scam.
He throws you a business card, and you find out that he actually is a director of a major Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if we have time, we can discuss with the company, and the remuneration must be inevitable."
You walked with him to the company without thinking, and he said he saw you in the street at the first sight, and really hoped you would come to participate.
You think there is nothing to lose and that you will still make money, so you sign a contract.
This is a big romantic reality show that is divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and amateurs will get along with each other in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.
In the later stages, they will enter into the game to pass through the levels together.
The official recording will begin next week, you have no idea who your partner will be, what interesting things will happen?
I stumbled upon the following article which discusses why this client wanted a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canned packaging from a commercial and shelf life perspective. Although canning belongs to deep processing and not within the scope of bonded logistics companies, the following article might explain why customers want to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and got in touch with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for packaged milk powder and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference at all.
Then everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of bags only one year and the shelf life of cans is two or more years?
Or ask: Why is there such a huge difference in price between cans and bags?
In fact, many consumers and mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different and therefore the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, except that everyone thinks the more expensive is the better.
There are consumers who reportedly said, after eating the canned food, that the taste or flavor of the canned product is different!
Now, let me first tell you the reason why listening equipment is expensive and what is the price?
Why is there such a large difference in the price of these same raw materials?
Most manufacturers considering when the package pricing is too high, consumers will be unable to accept it, which means that the profits made by manufacturers are very low or there is no profit, so how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have had a large increase in the pricing of canned items to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers are recommending the packaging in cans, not bags.
And you would think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars each year in advertising, so where do these costs come from?
We can all imagine it.
Then, with the development of society, market promotion expenses, such as sales staff in shopping malls, exhibition fees at shopping malls, gift fees for products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, manufacturers are continuously adding new products, and the prices of them are also rising continuously. In fact, these are new products that have been introduced as market costs increase.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits; in fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands who, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulously linked them with the hospital doctors, who would assist in product promotion and receive a profit ranging from 30-80 yuan.
In China, such operations are absolutely forbidden by relevant laws. This method is actually causing harm to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy milk powder in bags and put them in the tin at home. This saves costs while improving the preservation and airtightness of the milk powder without affecting the children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned products is longer than that of bags. If the cans have the same shelf life as bags after they are opened, it’s just that the bags are not easy to store after opening and are prone to getting wet and deteriorating.
I just came across an article about menstrual holidays, but it's too long.
Let me give advice to people who do not know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual period some time between the ages of 13 and 15 and amenorrhea around age 50.
Afterwards, I will be doing this on a more regular basis once each month, provided my body is healthy.
However, it isn't regular enough to accurately predict. There is a tolerance of about a week or so and preparations need to be made in advance. Sometimes, it will overturn with bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The duration of time, blood volume, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week.
My menstrual cycle is uncontrollable and bleeding comes within 24 hours from beginning to end, and all I can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to stop the blood from reaching clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately before the menstrual period begins may effectively alleviate the pain in that month, but taking it after the dysmenorrhea begins is useless.
During the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If your cycle is about to arrive and you have diarrhea for no reason, you will typically menstruate within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise, they are likely to breed bacteria and eliminate sleep time. In a worst-case scenario, they may need to be replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which means 42 pieces. If you add the amount prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, rather than one piece every month.
(I make a modification here, the tampons don’t have to be changed often, about once every five or six hours, the longest is eight hours)
Hormones may wreak havoc during menstruation. During ovulation, the body is also unstable because of changes in hormones, which is very unfortunate and the body makes trouble for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions, and they will not use emotional problems as excuses.
It wasn't just blood that was flowing and it included the shedding of the lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the most thin, but gradually grew to be thicker after that. This can be viewed as a house.
Menstrual period is very inconvenient. For decades, bleeding is detected 24/7 on several days a month, as well as abdominal pain. Who would like that?
But people get born because their mothers have menstruation. And menstruation is to prepare you for living in this world for ten months when you first come to the world. Everyone should thank their mothers for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society thought that women were dirty and shameful. People thought that was so, but the times have changed.
If anyone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that women's body preparation practices that give birth to life are disgusting, and shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking this way. Men who have never experienced it, won't experience it in their lifetime, and don't know much about it, shouldn't be so ungrateful. How can you be so embarrassed to face your mother and want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they’re really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, via rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are basic principles of philosophy that aim to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name ”metaphysics” is taken from the word “Metaphysical is called Way, what is beneath form is called implement”, which was translated by Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji Era) by metaphysic.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is “the study on which nouns represent real entities while which nouns simply represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
It is theoretically based on the concept that all phenomena can be explained by natural causes, put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a method for research that makes no mention of God.
Philosophy of the Mind is the branch of philosophy that investigates the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought in discussing the "relationship between mind and body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and extent of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study about the moral life of humans; here, morality is defined as all norms of conduct agreed upon by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (which abstractly studies the nature of ethical theories or criticism), normative ethics (which estimates diverse moral values and proposes moral codes for right and wrong conduct).
It studies what patterns of moral conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live, and summarizing observed patterns.
It examines ethics not from preconceived theories but looks at actual decisions made and observed by an actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to that choice, and discusses ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: humanistic ethics, represented by those including Valera and Montaigne.
Part II: The ethical thinking of the Reformation, as represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics
Logic is a discipline that studies "principles and standards for valid inference and justification."
Logic generally includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a science that’s the subject of research into the nature and meaning of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the 30 years after our relatives were killed, especially the unstoppable assistance since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends home and abroad, in early 1994.
Now most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started their own families and have jobs.
It was your acts of kindness that have helped us through the most difficult times for those struggling families.
The coronavirus pandemic is currently raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop offering donations to our troubled family — the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid campaign should have seen its perfect ending.
I will always remember your love and I firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, and I ask for your understanding!
Please accept my sincere blessings
Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance being done by IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
The IFAD and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations in engaging in humanitarian aid, and executors of the projects often overlap.

Oftentimes, relief funds cannot be delivered to families of victims of the June 4th Incident.
In 1994, upon the suggestion by Ms. Ding, “Tiananmen Mothers” set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphan Education Fund which was implemented 11 years later. In 2009, after all June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF set up the June 4th Aided Senior Orphans Assistance Fund, and it has been running since.
Funding for these projects is primarily from the campus and community donations made on June 4, the generous donations of individuals, and supports from the Fraternal Universities Foundation for Democracy.
It has also received the support of the Laogai Research Foundation since 2018.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the family members of the victims of the June Fourth finally received a part of donations from Hong Kong raised in the name of June Fourth.
During this time, the Human Rights Society of China has been independently implementing their humanitarian assistance program.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop donation was for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed some retirees whose income is not as plentiful as before retirement. We would like to express our appreciation to Mr. Ding for his letter "To a Friend".
We will respect the decision made by our families to terminate this program within two years and resume as soon as the need arises.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those who are generous and have been taking risks to deliver humanitarian donations throughout the years.

If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you have no idea in this area, it is best to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot and takes 6 months.
But if you plan on getting in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those people who have very weak self-control.
If you have relatively strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
If the teaching staff are not strong enough, this training establishment is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong staff.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to explore the students coming from this institution. After all, only the students of an institution know what is going on, and whether the courses presented are good or not.
Hi, I don’t know how to answer your question, because I haven’t done any introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your own circumstances.
Things such as majors, age, language you want to learn, or even in which city you are, will all be related to the industry you want to study or you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have already graduated from the computer major, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective training facility.
However, in these circumstances, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are free now, or there are many training resources on B station. If you are unable to find resources, you can also contact me through the profile for free resources or detailed consultations!
In addition, there are some relatively classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but also can pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then I suggest you study at a training institution, so that learning is not too much effort, the teacher can explain it in details, and someone will specifically answer any questions.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, and they provide options to recommend transfer to companies after training, so that the interview process for job hunting can save a lot of time.
What I have said above include my thoughts and descriptions as I do not know your personal situation and I will not explain in detail. If you have any other questions, you can always contact me to communicate.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, cooking hoods, lamps, cleaning, professional beauty and housekeeping services.
Thanks for those who have given me praise silently, I work hard for my life, life is very tiring but we must continue
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, please follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me praise
Life is like this, others only look at the result and stand alone in the process. Facing life, we have no choice but to continue, to be strong. We can look back but not go back.”
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although we do the dirtiest job in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer’s home with the most serious attitude. Seeing satisfied smiles and thumbs up from customers, all the hard work will be worthwhile at that moment, and the efforts will ultimately pay off!

Things are not working well in all industries today!
But I have always believed that as long as I am earnest, persistent and hardworking, I will be better than others, or at least it is better than sitting around and complaining.”
The plan of a day starts in the morning, and all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start your new day with happiness, luck, health, and self-fulfillment. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and I was happy if I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal advocated for fulfillment; when I was mature, I found that happiness is a state of mind, and I was feeling happy when I understood it.
Be the most genuine and kind self, live with our heart, without regrets in your life; we must take our own way in life; there are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and a beautiful life!
Different challenges arise in every stage of life.
In many cases it is not your ability that restrains you, but your courage to face it in a positive way.
Since there is no way to avoid this, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you are overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face up to them, the problem will eventually be solved.
Second, although the right wing had an era of success going on in history, it was of a short duration. Short because if you gave it just a bit of sunlight, it would brighten, and when you drink boiling water, you would perspire.
But in all truth, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy and improving technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not quite agree with Li Weidong’s remarks, I care about what he means and respect him very much; because he is serious about China, and he takes China’s social issues seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-revolutionary revolution will inevitably lead to social instability, damage to people’s livelihood, mixed political societies and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and people. Those who attempt to gain opportunities through political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Lets talk about the left again.
The Left is, in fact, a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to their remarks and analyze their thoughts when needed, the Left will not have such a fortune because what the Left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. I recently saw some friends being genuinely angry while confronting the illegitimate thief, I don’有人 think it’s unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors or the left-handed defectors, they are all silly and unreasonable.
It isn’t necessary to try to prove that we are right, let alone allow the rebels and left-handed bullies to admit it. Why are they here?
Let me tell my friends this: When a rebel scolds you for five cents and when the creeps call you a bull, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they get older, they forget their ideals, or pursue them but become paranoid.
The slayers get farther and farther away from this ideal, and even the hero who kills a dragon eventually turns into an evil dragon.
I feel left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China is a largely left-leaning nation due to the innate genes from its history and culture.
While domestic right-wingers advise on freedom and focus on efficiency and development, the leftists reinforce regulation and place a higher importance on fairness and security.
The society now generally wishes to put more emphasis on fairness. At the same time, the conflict in the US and China's left-wing is certain. It's estimated to continue for many years.
Even though I can't understand it, just comment and it's done
No need to say anything, Huahua is so unselfish
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists have not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-based enterprises.
The US oppresses China's chip industry and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing chip manufacturers to reduce research and development investment, and production capacity. This has resulted in global shortage of chip supply chains.
Presently, “chips shortage” has spread to major industries in the world. For example, automakers have closed production and cell phone prices have increased. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
To maintain the global semiconductor power and hold back the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has made frequent actions recently, hosting a “chip summit”. It has invited 64 giants to set up semiconductor alliances, and funded support for American technology giants. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip sector, the old technology giant Intel has invested 20 billion U.S. dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and open up the chip foundry business.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely that it will take away TSMC's "job".
This is because Intel, as an existing technology giant in the US, has been involved in the semiconductor field for decades and possesses a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise up quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive of Intel’s decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising speech. Regarding Intel's move to invest in building a foundry, Zhang Zhongmou spoke bluntly: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel’s entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still bears a grudge that has existed between TSMC and Intel over the past 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been the jewel of the US Empire’s manufacturing industry, held the top position in the world, and was the hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model in which chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were done by one factory. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small firms overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs cannot cope with enormous cost of building production lines.
Inspired by market demand, a phenomenon of division of labor began to appear in the chip industry after the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was specialized design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single aspect of "wafer processing". It does not design anything, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, a company that had just been founded at the time, was a minion in the face of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only doing manufacturing in the chip industry, it obviously looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel had looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect that giants that looked down on wafer fabrication services in the past would now also start wafer foundries.
As such, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry.
TSMC’s market capitalization has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with an aggressive attack from TSMC, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Let's look at some of the [strangely popular searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Eryon in February, Orion’s price increase, and the goods pulling event. Public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then the “exponential decrease” (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion arises, a small hump will appear again.
They look the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
What is abnormal public opinion?
6 hot search items in the same event were randomly selected, displaying [simple peak shape], [jagged shape], [cliff shape].
[Solid Peak] means artificially heating its list to quickly improve the search and attract public attention; [Jawtooth] means periodical heating to ensure that a topic takes the top spot on the search list; [Cliff] means瞰 collectively, the search has finished its “function”, and then it receives new tasks, and rushes to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the crest of one event's popularity happens to be the trough of another event with exactly the same time. Then a unified batch of naval forces must have received a mission to start a new offensive.
One can see the professionalization of black public relations: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which are attracting attention, which are responsible for science popularization, which promote competition, which divert attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgments, which generates sentiments, which coerce decision-making. The hacker accounts are segmented and refined operations at different nodes, almost considering all factors in the spread of public sentiment.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of opinion and sentiment, and considering objective data alone, there will be nowhere to hide in public public relations.
Anything we walk through will leave traces. We can dig out such traces together.

What is the difference between laser TVs and traditional TVs in terms of market positioning?
In my opinion, the traditional TV the topic refers to is LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly comes from the following two points:
First, laser TVs are focused more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products made for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly from 55 to 65 inches, while those of laser TVs are generally over 75 inches and the largest is over 100 inches, fully satisfying users’ needs for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, global shipments and sales volume of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for over 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMC's forecast, sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why laser TV has such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to its outstanding performance in eye protection.
Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and causes less irritation to the eyes.
Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Institute and an eye expert from Beijing Union medical institution have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative experiment in which people watched laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions.
It has been confirmed by the data that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection properties, and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health has received more and more importance, laser TVs not only attract more and more users by its advantages of eye protection, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline of prices for LCD TVs, prizes of most laser TVs currently on the market exceed 10,000 yuan and are gradually rising as size and light sources are upgraded.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV or projection.
With the use of ultra-short focus projection technology, laser TVs achieve a shorter projection distance compared with traditional projection devices, and allow for the ability to experience a large 100-inch screen within a short distance.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it generates less heat, less wear to the equipment, and the lifespan of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as equivalent 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring more impressive visual experience to users.
It’s not pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. For picture quality and input-output ratio, Laser TV is not just for audiovisual players.
Simply put, ultra wide-angle near-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which are not in line with optics’ optimal design.
Using a microstructured Fresnel curtain in order to shield part of the ambient light is expensive, and a 80-inch LCD can be basically replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point is that I particularly hate the idea of the diffuse reflection being nice to the eyes, because it is a selling point for projector manufacturers. Please, what the eyes can see on the screen is the direct light.
Moreover, if the projection screen were not diffusely reflected, there would be no image at all.
The hot spot effect of high gain screen is just ignored, it is really uncomfortable when a lot of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle.
Is it safe to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Umbrella is an Internet based insurance brokerage platform.
A few key terms: The shareholder and the promoter must have no major law violation records in the last 3 years. The minimum amount required to establish the security brokerage institution is RMB 50 million. It needs the permission of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three terms are actually very strict, and they are indeed strong. They must be authorized by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (the nation’s domestic authority over private insurance), and shareholders must have good conduct. As a small umbrella insurance brokerage company, investors should not question whether the small umbrella insurance is验证 or not. After all, no insurance company can meet these three restrictions.
At this point, there is no problem. It is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products, Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many celebrities critical illness guidelines are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet-based products have high cost performance, support fees for monthly payment, reduce payment pressures on policyholders, and maximize insurance leverage.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of clerk professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is an extremely demanding industry, and many Internet product customers can either apply for insurance on their own. As such, there are numerous misunderstandings such as health notification and occupation;
I myself have done insurance telesales on "Tencent We-Insurance" (like Umbrella, also a platform for Internet insurance brokers), so I am very responsible to share this with others.
Internet insurance is real, and reliable, but people cannot be trusted. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels and there are many misleading salespeople.
For example: 1 yuan of 6 million Insurance plans, buy insurance to get mobile authorization, receive 60,000 critical illness coverage for free, these marketing strategies are correct, but they ignore the major ones. They won't tell the insured that they require one yuan per month to pay the normal amount.
I thought we could spend 1 dollar and the insurer will pay 6 million (the world has fallen out of pie).
Free mobile phone delivery, sent only to special policy numbers such as 6666, 8888. The winning SMS will not be exchanged, nor will anyone remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short term, and if this is the only insurance policy, there is no commercial insurance to cover it. In the event of serious illness, what can I do? It can't solve the problem and my future life will start playing around.
At present, the state is also severely cracking down on misleading insurance sales on the Internet.
So on a whole, there is no problem with the platform or product. What is problematic is the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople.
In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokerage companies are broader, and customers have many opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I've personally helped 59 Internet customers in underwriting offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan per year in insurance premium per person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to connect and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance brokers, have three years experience in corporate management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will customize insurance products for clients based on customer’s needs.
We grow together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to everyone!
According to the definition by insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is insurance in which an applicant can complete all insurance application processes independently after clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant. All steps can be completed by the insured by themselves.
Although online insurance purchase is not too "ceremonial", and may even not contain a printed paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract in any way.
This model is similar to “telephone sales” outside the ordinary pipeline, but there is a fatal problem when purchasing insurance this way, which is that subsequent services might not keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When purchasing insurance, we should carefully consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is a long-term companion for us and will provide services to us in many years.
From before to now, I have always opposed slander and abuse in any form, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such villains.
If one does not look at political parties and factions, the first thing that must be resisted is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From your Facebook friending request followed by snarky posts, to your attempt to reveal my home place and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only keep tagging me on the basis of the frequency of 6 meals per day, but also continued to discuss some low-key and humiliating remarks about me
I know that afterwards I received emails from a number of friends about uploading a photo on your Facebook friend account and sexually harassing remarks.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I just can't be silent any longer.
After the news of my police report was uploaded, you did not restrain yourselves at all. Instead, you became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you have. In our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can keep making those bombastic, veiled, humiliating, abusive things. You can keep saying you just care and follow me. You can keep calling it harassment. You can even deny it wasn't your image and keep making all kinds of offensive statements.
Yes, I cannot, and I have no power to, stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to meet you, nor do I need your judgment about my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl who would be willing to shame others in the exchange for fame.
My friend asked me if I was doing okay?
I said it and you won't believe me.
I don't think there's any girl that can still say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics, or the business world, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that fairness is at the heart of it all.
I cut a part of the message out for everyone to comment on
There should be no one else who can impersonate you in your own postings
all I can say is that you are the enemy of civilization
I smiled knowingly
These three U.S. aircraft carriers, equipped to accumulate the most powerful weapons near China, make a rare visit to Guam
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", the USS Carl Vinson was discovered by a satellite near the Barabac Strait on January 9.
Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategically important location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that "Carl Vinson will be deployed in the South China Sea."
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Osprey carrier aircraft on board.
One of the US military aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which will depart the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also was the first carrier to carry a fleet of F-35C aircraft belonging to the 314th Fighter Strike Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Aside from the above two carriers, the current US Navy deployment in the Asia-Pacific region also includes the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform” released the latest satellite photos showing that three US aircraft carriers were assembling near China.
(Weibo@South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China to make a rare visit to Guam January 17, 2022, the flight path of a US carrier-based transport plane CMV-22B.
According to a report from CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam this past weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base on Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers made their rare visit to Guam with the most powerful weapons around China, which analysts said was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and just the second public visit to it since the 1980s.
In recent years, the United States has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture shows Yongshu Island in China's Nansha Islands.
The visit to Guam intensifies cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and demonstrates US capability, flexibility, readiness and continuing commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific, the Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder" submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are typically kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the vessel “the most critical survival weapon in the nuclear triad,” which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located across the U.S. and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, a market valuation likely to fall by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he "faced unprecedented competition". What's the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is actually an advertising company, and it generates its income mainly from advertisements. Nowadays, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning it is, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertising network”, and many apps are connected with Meta advertisements and realizing earnings through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to adjustments of Apple’s privacy policies, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain information about users, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apples current privacy policies are very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to access their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely to not allow it.
Next, if Google revs up again, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10 percent of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by companies in China doing overseas business.
Meta has roughly a few hundred people in its offices in Hong Kong and several major agencies in the mainland.
Meta is an inescapable advertising channel for Chinese companies that want to expand to overseas markets, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte-based TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I have not been specifically looking into this recently, but it’s definitely not going to be any better than before.
The phase in which Chinese companies were burning cash overseas on a massive scale has ended.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only cares about income, more importantly it looks at what the future is expected to look like.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were insufficient.
In an attempt to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta within these two years.
So in the next two years, it should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Despite its popularity, Facebook has revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion a year, but Facebook has a huge sense of crisis now. Compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no safe moat.
Although several of his social apps have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook still lacks confidence in the face of the rapid development of Tiktok. Any subversion is a blink of an eye.
The limitless concept of the metaverse has no hopes of success in the short term and therefore Facebook is very dangerous. That is the reason why Zuckerberg has changed his company's name and is constantly searching for new tracks. However, I think his single choice of track is wrong and it is a road of no return. Above are my thoughts for reference.
