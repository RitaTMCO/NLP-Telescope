First of all, I think "Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spot, it's not. At least the soundtrack selection is very good.
There are many kinds of bad films, including those that make you fall asleep in the cinema and those that make you angry after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted at insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in grams of novels, which is difficult to describe. There are many loopholes like the windbreaker on brother pony.
Even after reading it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male owner should live on an island in the south and depend on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
The old man watched the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
How did his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small gangsters of the island's flying car party easily close a mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why does a small gangster flying car party with poor credit reporting and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't the police call the police? In the movie, the police specially asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but he doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to sit outside the room and sleep for a night without finding the hotel owner?
This kind of inexplicable plot is full of the whole film. Because the plot is so outrageous that I feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, which is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the difficult survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all. With it, you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit during the Spring Festival.
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeds step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should honestly talk about the feud between the young people in the town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least your plot can't appear anything contrary to the normal world.
(for example, Yin Zheng's new motorcycle has just been burned and can sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the hostess is clearly not retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own films?
Is such a film arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to practice at the same price first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then expensive rackets will normally be more friendly than cheap rackets. This kind of "entry-level rackets" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low. When the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. The hard ball can't stand it, and it's difficult for masters to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult. I know you can't learn it, and I know you're not willing to buy expensive ones. Make a bargain to fool you. If you play it twice, you won't play it again. In this way, the racket is cheap, and you don't feel distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to buy a second-hand better racket at a similar price, and choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell at a price. A new racket of 500 or 600 is very good, and a second-hand racket of 200 yuan. Isn't it delicious to have a thousand yuan racket?
It's very friendly to novices, but it's useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest year in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was a popular article "look! Project managers can compete for gold medal Olympic projects," which mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match: moving bricks, going on business, staying up late are the daily work of project managers, and it is not a matter of fire fighting, carrying the pot, and apologizing.
An article that looks like a joke also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inadequacy of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get rid of their difficulties in work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the 20-year development report of China's project management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national cumulative number of PMP® applicants was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP® holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience." The rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten fields and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management.
Many project managers often feed back the following problems: the project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and I don't know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project procrastination; The members' division of labor is not clear, and the "old timers" in the team don't know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance. The communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to promote
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China enterprise R & D management talent training demonstration base," came with the online course "R & D project manager special training camp."
[special training camp for R & D project managers] online course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
There is no evidence for words. You can first see how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.
It is said that the exhaust sound of super running in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's next generation model - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year. Four wheel drive, why is it called lp700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It's probably that Xiaobian's myvi will reach 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
Don't say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
The posture of getting on and off the bus should be practiced, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will be unable to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
If the engine is too loud, you will suddenly be deaf after getting off the bus. (but it's still cool)
The car body is too big. It will be very narrow when parking in an ordinary parking space. I'm afraid of being knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run of this video is not for sale, sorry!

Involving a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that cyclists all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of super cars Chiron in just a few minutes!
It makes sense to look at the results!
At the time of NFT's rapid emergence, a new concept of encrypted community emerged.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "axie infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie infinity is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest trading volume at present, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to tokenterminal data, axie infinity's daily income is more than $8.2 million, close to the glory of the king.
On August 6 this year, axie infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "axie infinity" has passed a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of investment target industries. First of all, we should choose industries with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future, and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market scale, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, do things right.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing," that is, do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new ones; On the basis of improving dau (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country El Salvador designated bitcoin as the legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "taproot," which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a plant located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After many on-site house visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the house owner, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the receipt of the deposit for the sale of the plant, which stated, "if the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double. Both parties agreed to sign the plant sales contract within a week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
When the deposit was paid and the house payment was ready, the seller refused to sell the house, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to Yuyao people's court.
After hearing, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[lawyer reminds] the necessary duty of prudence should be performed in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should do its necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian. This is your second week in Japan.
You walk in the street and suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear and finally run.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait!" (full Japanese conversation) You stopped at the gate of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. I think you look beautiful. Are you interested in participating in the reality show?"
You are confused and afraid that this is a scam.
He slipped you a business card, and you found that he was really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If you have time, miss, we can go to the company to talk about it. The film salary must be indispensable."
You came to the company with him in a muddleheaded way. He said that he saw you in the street at a glance and hoped you could come.
You thought there was no loss and you could make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale love reality show, which is divided into two parts.
In the early stage, stars and ordinary people will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.
In the later stage, they will enter the game to break through the barrier together.
The official recording will begin next week. You don't know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen?
I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans two years or more?
Or ask: why is the price difference between tinned and bagged so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers also say that the taste or taste of tinned clothes is different after eating out of this mentality!
Now let me tell you the reason why tinned clothes are expensive. Where is it?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of tinned goods to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote tinned rather than bagged.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
With the development of society, the market promotion expenses, such as the promotion personnel of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and the price of tinned clothes is also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, hook up with doctors in the hospital by all means, and they will assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans on the premise that you have cans at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of tinned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of tinned goods is the same as that of bagged goods after unpacking, it's just that it's not easy to preserve and get damp and deteriorate after unpacking.
I just saw an article about menstruation. It's too long.
Give science to men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual leave one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea at the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, they will come once a month regularly.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, with bad luck, the car will overturn (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people for three days, some people for a week; Some people flow less, some people have metrorrhagia; Some people don't respond, some people feel pain until the ambulance takes them away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not feeling pain before doesn't mean not feeling pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation can't be controlled. You can bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. It is useless to eat ibuprofen before the physiological period begins. It can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the physiological period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If it's about the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(modify here, the tampon does not need to be changed often, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may be irritable, and ovulation may also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky. The body makes itself a stumbling block.
However, the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's also endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and the cycle begins again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds 24 hours a few days a month, and it also causes abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed. Society brainwashed women as dirty and ashamed. Everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the female body's preparation for life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think so. Men who have never experienced it, won't experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and unkind. How can this attitude be kind to their mother, and how can they think of their own children with kindness?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They are really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "metaphysics is the way, and metaphysics is the tool" in the book of changes, which is translated from metaphysic by Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to "study which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of not saying a word about God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a subject of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta ethics (to study the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (to judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and summarizing from the observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this decision. It studies the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by vara and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume and others, 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire and others, 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant and Hegel and others, 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham and Siguivik and others, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, German neo Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier and others, late 19th century, neo Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green and others), transitional ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and others).
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof."
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of studying the essence and significance of beauty.
Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994, which has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become married and employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop making humanitarian donations to our difficult group of Tiananmen mothers. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the all aesthetics free association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project executors often cross.

The relief funds often fail to reach the June 4th Movement smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of teacher Ding, the "Tiananmen mother" set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th orphan education fund." After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th orphan elderly special poverty relief fund," which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and were supported by the Democracy Foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the reform through labor research foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of the June 4th movement finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th movement.
During this period, China human rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that teacher Ding's call to stop the June 4th donation is for the consideration of donors. We are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby thank teacher Ding for his "letter to friends."
We will respect the decision of the refugees, terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have insisted on giving generously and risking the risk of delivering humanitarian relief funds for many years.
A programming Xiaobai who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have extremely weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, it depends on the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, the teaching staff of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how this institution is and whether the courses explained are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated, or have graduated from computer major, then if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but first, the learning cost is high, and second, the time invested is relatively large, which basically requires centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the network are free, or there are many training resources in station b. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to study in a training institution. In this way, the study is not very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, and there are also special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion quotas, and recommend to the company after learning, so that the later job interview process can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. As I said earlier, because I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction and it's not detailed. If you have other things you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted boiler water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, professional sewing, housekeeping services
Thank those who silently praise me. I work hard for life. Life is very tired, but I have to continue
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard. Pay attention to me if you like it. Thank those who silently praise me
Life is like this. Others only look at the results and support the process by ourselves. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back but can't go back...
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of intention.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest work we do, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. When we see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will be rewarded!
My daily work
- your request, my service.
Serve attentively, clean attentively, and retain beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui housekeeping has helped you to "clean" what I can, serve and love your family.
Keep thousands of families clean, build a reputation for housekeeping, provide services in place, and make them clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine brilliantly, and so is life
Only by doing it with heart can we succeed. We are serious about creating exquisite and beautiful stitches with care.
Give me a chance, will make you satisfied, quality means everything, because professional trustworthy, your recognition is my most encouraged!
At present, all walks of life are hard to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining"!
The plan of the day is in the morning. All the good things begin in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good luck, and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and having it was happiness; When I grew up, happiness was a goal, and when I reached it, I was happy; When I matured, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and understanding was happiness.
Be the truest and kindest yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; There are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and being beautiful forever!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Most of the time, what binds you is not your ability, but your courage to face it positively.
Since we can't avoid it, we'd better face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problem will be solved.
2. Although the Rightists have a successful era in history, it is not long, so it is short because giving a little sunshine makes them bright and drinking some boiled water makes them sweat; A little success will lead to Longwangshu, and a blow will lead to Mao's attachment.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the Rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As for me, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that counter revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make money from political speculation are not Rightists, but bastards.
Talk about Zuo again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while opposing the thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all one track minded and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti thief and left epilepsy admit, why?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti thief scolds you for five cents, and when Zuo Dian scolds you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
He gradually drifted away from his ideal, and even the dragon slayer finally became a dragon.
I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom. China should be leftist as a whole due to the innate genes of history and culture.
The domestic rightists are free and pay attention to efficiency and development, while the leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will fight on the left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, just praise it
Don't say anything. Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US emperor not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises in its allies to blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R & D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global disorder of chip supply chain shortages.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has affected all major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the rise in the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip," more and more national technology giants began to move towards the road of "de beautification."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and Laos have made frequent moves recently and hosted the "chip summit"; It also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take the "rice bowl" of TSMC.
The reason why Intel is so sure is that as an old technology giant of the United States, Intel has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 master think tank forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made amazing remarks. For Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples and said bluntly: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge against Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the peak position in the world and the overlord in the semiconductor field in the world.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode. Chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by one factory. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing." It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, it was obvious that it looked down on TSMC and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer processing services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giants who despised wafer manufacturing services in those days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic that Intel has entered wafer foundry.
Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has made a sprint towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Today, let's watch some [strange hot searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February Erlong rise, Haoliyou price rise, and Hualala incident. Public opinion spreads to form a wave crest, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, small humps will appear again.
They seem to be no different from the "evolution model of online public opinion" shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [solitary peak], [zigzag], [cliff].
[solitary peak] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search list, causing public concern; [zigzag] that is, periodic heating, ensuring that topics occupy the hot search list; [cliff] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has played its "function," received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of naval forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making, and the refined operation of black production accounts in batches and nodes, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Regardless of all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces. We will dig out such traces together.
Data source: hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is the product of large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the sales volume of laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why we have such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of electronic technology standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirmed that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the declining price of LCD TV, the price of laser TV on the market is mostly more than ten thousand yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must be reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With the ultra short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize the 100 inch large screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra high definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of video and audio players. If you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing, you can judge by yourself, and you're afraid to listen to one side of the story.
In short, in order to get close to the screen, the ultra wide angle close focus projector laser TV has to use expensive ultra wide angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive. The price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65 inch LCD.
Another thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for their eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. If you have to be serious, LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light." Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot be imaged at all.
The hot spot (spot) effect of the high gain screen is just ignored. A large amount of light at a certain angle is reflected to the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the supervision of insurance brokerage institutions (revised in 2015) " tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, and the minimum limit is 50 million yuan before it can be established, which must be approved by the CIRC.
These three are actually very harsh. To sum up, they need to be strong, approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders should have a good style of work. As an insurance brokerage company, the applicant does not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai super Mary 5 serious illness insurance. The claim adjuster and insurer are Hetai life insurance. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson's wages, Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of policyholders, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesperson's professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can insure by themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when insuring, feeling that they are healthy or in line with, which is easy to have many hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Weibo" (like small umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable. What is unreliable is people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are also many misleading sales.
For example, there is nothing wrong with these marketing strategies: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million yuan, buying insurance for free mobile phones, and receiving 60000 serious illness insurance amount for free. However, they avoid the important points and don't tell the applicant that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to normal fees, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers don't know what they bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
Thinking it could cost 1 yuan, the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world lost pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent in the special policy number segment such as 66668888, and if the winning SMS is sent, he will not exchange it and no one will remind him.
(this is another pit for the policyholder) It is short-term to receive 60000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, 6 universal why can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So from a comprehensive point of view, there is no problem with the platform and the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the subject should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products and save 2000-3000 yuan / year for each premium.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, who has three years of enterprise management training experience, has served nearly 1000 enterprise users, and cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will arrange and trust insurance policies for customers, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the applicant independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony," and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but there will also be a fatal problem when buying insurance in this way, that is, the subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
From the past to the present, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style of work that should be resisted first.
Since you began to send Facebook friend requests, and then published ridicule posts, and then you tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good breeding, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, I... forget it.
How did I know that later I received a number of friends' comments about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't stop at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your status. In our society, we need gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make such ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you just love and care about me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that it is not your plan or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need your comment.
I don't even think there will be any girl willing to let others humiliate herself in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's OK after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut some messages for you to comment
No one can pretend to be you in your own post
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
smile with understanding
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 multidimensional pro communist media multidimensional reports: the latest news on China U.S. relations: the latest satellite images show that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indian Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea strategic situational awareness platform," a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform predicts that Carl Vinson will deploy in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that Carl Vinson has deployed with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser Lake Champlain and the missile destroyer Stockdale.
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea strategic situational awareness platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers were assembling around China.

(Weibo @ strategic situational awareness in the South China Sea) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam on a rare occasion last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. The analysis said that this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the India Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the United States, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indian Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of 14 "thundering submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make "thundering submarines" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity." This system also includes ballistic missiles in silos located in the United States, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are meta traffic channels.
Not only that, meta is also the largest "advertising alliance." Many apps are connected to meta's advertising, which is realized through meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, meta is difficult to get users' data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and will obviously prompt users whether to allow apps to access their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs again, it will have a greater impact on meta's revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in meta's income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
Meta has about hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of meta's main competitors, but meta can make a lot of money from byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping byte to advertise in meta, and meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't learned about it recently, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but also depends on the future expectations.
Obviously, meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metauniverse."
Metauniverse should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the implementation cycle of metauniverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in these two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now, with an annual income of $100 billion to $200 billion, in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good security moat.
Although the daily life of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of metauniverse has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changes the name of the company and keeps looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and there is no way back. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
