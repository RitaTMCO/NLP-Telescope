First of all, to conclude, I personally think that "Shikai" is an all-round crappy film, in all senses.
But if you're going to say that there's not a single bright spot in this movie, then at least the soundtrack isn't too good.
Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Kang is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it looks like it's a creation from a Crimean novel. It's unremarkable, and it's as leaky as a sweater on a kid's coat.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's any metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it's just a piece of shit.
To begin with, let me briefly describe some of the plots that I find difficult to understand.
The man's place of residence was supposed to be on a small island to the south, where he lived with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a neighbor's grandfather to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
An elderly man sees snow from the south to the northeast in a van?
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then the old man didn't write.
How does a landlady's brother get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
On the island flying party small crowd Why can you lightly and smoothly block off a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck that delivered the reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not be found all around.
The feel of the tool is too obvious.
Why would an untrustworthy and illegally suspected gangster become an aide-de-camp?
Faced with high interest rate loans why not call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there is a difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door in a hotel with a room card, then forcibly arranges not to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the door of the room to sleep?
This mysterious plot pervades the whole film, and it pains me when I recall it because it's so bizarre.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the film's subject matter, or the fact that the film has no subject matter at all, and it's a hideous-looking sewing freak.
At the beginning of the movie you think he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an encouraging film, halfway through you think it may be a drama that shows how difficult it is for a small town youth to survive, and after watching it you don't know exactly what you saw, followed by a deep suspicion of yourself, why go to the movie theater to enjoy the big over the year.
For most people, you're actually pretty familiar with all kinds of movie scenarios. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, enthusiasm + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird of prey progresses to success one step at a time.
If you want to make a love movie, you have to tell the truth about the feud between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and a maid's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot shouldn't contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's new motorcycle has just been burned down, and then he's still a singing character), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the hostess is not weak-minded and can act in some ways like a five-year-old child, I really do not know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand why Han Kang, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies.
This kind of film is arranged in the Spring Festival stalls, is not it to give the audience a blockade?
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

I'd like to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up, so I'd like to find a trainer for the same price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices tend to be proportional to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then normally expensive situations are more friendly than cheap ones, which are actually industrial rubbish.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not be overcome, it is difficult to master.
The logic and subtext of their existence is-- tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn, you know you don't want to buy expensive stuff, you mess around with cheap stuff, you play twice, you don't play again, so it's cheaper and you don't care.
When you really know what's good and what's bad, it means you're making progress, and then come back and I'll buy expensive stuff here, and I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racquet, choose PRInce, or Dunlop, both brands are not famous enough, so a good racquet does not sell the price, the new 500, 600 is good, second-hand 200, the enjoyment of having a thousand yuan?
It's very friendly to beginners, but once you've passed the beginner's stage you're broke, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner's stage.

What will be the biggest fire in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Project managers can impact the gold medals of the Olympic GamesThe article is very hot, in which mentions the project managers in many projects, absolutely can be a horse first, no one can be: Move brick, business trip, stay up at night is the project manager's daily life, rescue fire, back boiler, apology is not even under the word.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, represented by the current project management inadequacy.
And the people who are engaged in project management, also gradually choose to take some action to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
As the number of PMP (Internationally Accredited Project Management Professional) applicants increases each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants registered in China, about 420,000 PMP® certified, and about 300,000 valid PMP® holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® holders.
Over the past decade, the number of PMP holders has grown year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that simply copying past "old experience" is no longer desirable, and that the ever-changing work environment lets us know a way to learn, to stand on the shoulders of the scientific giant and explore the way forward.
However, is it possible to ensure smooth project management by taking the PMP exam?
Many beginners in project management say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other relevant knowledge points.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: lack of understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, cannot land on the job, project estimation is inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragging on and on; division of labor among members is not clear, the "old oil strip" in the team does not know how to cope with interdepartmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ......
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management field more than ten decades, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has received the honorable title of "Chinese companies R&D management talent training demonstration base" and so on, China Tianhua summer consultation with the "R&D project manager special training camp" on-line course came.
R&D Project Manager Training Camp Online Course This is an online defragmented learning method, combining numerous R&D-type enterprises real-life cases, tools and methods, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, on the way to the advancement of their own project management.

Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, help students to translate the content of learning into concrete work after class.
Nominated New Mountain Area ultra-run exhaust sound is the biggest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model — the Aventador LP700-4!
Nearly two million dollars, a year's toll, ten thousand dollars, four-wheel drive, why LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
The data says that 0-100 km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, it is probably the article's myvi to reach 30 km/h when people have to 100 km/h, well.
The low body, the noisy scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the car and the 6.5 V12 engine overlooking the glass perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google oneself, the reporter put together some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too much attention, wherever everyone is watching, very uncomfortable!(Actually, a little refreshing)
1km oil money is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting up and down, or it'll be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine sound is too loud, you will be deaf immediately after getting out of the car. (However, it is still very refreshing)
The car body is too big, parked in the ordinary parking lot will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked at the door of the next car!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (the reporter's own story, has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your favorite car, please contact us!
More information about cars you don't know can be found in The Car Guide / People's Car Diary

Look at the results, expensive is reasonable!
As the NFT exploded, a new concept emerged for the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a major impact in Southeast Asia, as residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-generation game that combines a variety of gameplay elements, including NFT, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project with over $3 billion in revenue.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earned over $8.2 million a day, pushing "Kingdom Glory".
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said it had over 1 million daily users.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, the player is no longer a single character, but can participate in the governance of the game's ecology in addition to gaining fun and economic returns from the game.
This autonomy is not granted by the game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises in the racetrack, that is, the choice of the industry that refers to the investment target, first of all, to choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of more than 100 billion; secondly, to choose an industry with good growth in the future, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
The wideness of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, the flatness or roughness of the track refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to do the things right.
The strategy is to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, above most tactical thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether the current domain is continuously deepening or expanding horizontally (strategic thinking); on how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can think about how to set the right activity KPI and achieve the right activity objectives, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate renewal; on how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can think about whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021, twelve years after its birth.
On 7 September, the small Central American country of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender, marking the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin Futures ETF to enter U.S. capital markets and a further expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory in Zhejiang's Yuyao Zhejiang Town, and after several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu made a deposit of 200,000 yuan through a bank transfer on the same day after consulting with Mr. Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, about the details of the purchase of the factory building.
"If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, the two parties agree to sign a contract for the purchase and sale of the factory within a week."
However, the two sides subsequently failed to reach agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment method of the factory building, which led to the delay in signing the contract.
Considering that the two sides could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the $200,000 deposit to Mr. Lu.
It was not easy to see the house, the deposit was paid, and the rent was ready, so he had to sign the contract "at the door," but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court held that the failure of both parties to conclude a formal contract in the end could not be attributed solely to the defendant and should reasonably be deemed to be a failure of consultation.Therefore, the deposit penalty rule should not be applied in this case and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract by double repayment of the deposit.
After the trial judgement, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance upheld the original verdict.
Counsel reminds you to exercise the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer must perform the necessary duties of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house has been occupied and other relevant information, and make clear in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract at the same time.
Your name is Zhengming, this is the second week you moved to Japan.
You walk in the street, and suddenly you see someone following you, and you walk faster and faster in fear, and finally you run.
The man chased after you: "Miss, please wait!"You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss . . . I'm a director, and I think you look beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You're suspicious. You're afraid it's a hoax.
He gave you a business card and you found out that he was really the director of a big Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if we have time, we can go to the company and talk.
You stumbled into the company with him, and he said he saw you in the street at a glance, and he hoped very much that you would join him.
You thought there was nothing to lose and you could make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale real-life love show, divided into two parts.
The early stages will allow celebrities and amateurs to get along in real life and cultivate harmony.
Later on, they will enter the game together.
Recording is due to start next week, and you don't know who your partner is going to be. What's going to be interesting?
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from the point of view of preservation period, why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with the canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the scope of operation of the bonded logistics company, here is the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder factories, contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials in the bags and the milk powder are the same, no difference at all.
Then you will surely ask: Why is the warranty period of the bag is one year, and the warranty period of the listening package is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is there such a big difference between the price of hearing aids and bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that it is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset eaten after the reaction also said that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why it sounds expensive. Where is it?
Why is the price differential so high when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers pricing take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or no profits, what can the manufacturers survive on?
So they have a big rise in the price of listening to guarantee their profit margin.
As a result, most manufacturers prefer hearing aids rather than bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, what's the cost?
You can imagine it.
With the development of society, the expenses of marketing, such as promotional personnel, display expenses, product gift expenses, advertising expenses, etc., are constantly increasing.
So the manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and are listening to, the price of which is also constantly rising, in fact, it is new products with the increase in market expenses.
The main aim is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, by all means, hook up with hospital doctors, by which they help to promote the products, from a listening profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's laws do not allow such practices, which are harmful to consumers.
It is advisable to buy packed milk powder in cans on the premise that you have a can at home, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than that of the bag, if the shelf life of the listening package after opening the bag and the shelf life of the bag is the same, just say that the bag is not easy to store after opening the bag, susceptible to moisture deterioration.
I just saw an article about taking a break. It's too long.
For men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause occurs around the age of 50.
Subsequently, the prerequisite for good health is a regular visit to the clinic every month.
But it is also not regular enough to be able to accurately predict, about a week's tolerance, need to prepare ahead of time, sometimes bad luck will turn (suddenly a few days ahead of time).
The length of time, the amount of blood and the degree of gout vary from person to person, some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have little flow, some people have a big hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, some people have pain that an ambulance takes away, gout will change over time.
The menstrual cycle is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is use a towel or sanitary pad to suck the blood and prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Painful menstruation is mainly because of the secretion of progesterone, when the menstrual period has not yet arrived at the beginning of the physiological period to quickly take ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain during the month, it is no use to eat after the beginning of the menstrual period.
Before the period of physiology because of uterine congestion and too much release of progesterone, easy to pull the stomach.
If it comes to the cycle, mysterious belly, basically in two days will come menstruation.
Towels are best changed once every two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to bacterial growth. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case scenario is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets.
(Change here. You don't have to change the sanitary pads all the time. You can change them once every five or six hours, for a maximum of eight hours.)
Menstrual hormones can be irritating, and ovulation can be emotionally unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is unfortunate, the body tries to hinder itself.
But official crime figures show that women’s ability to control their emotions is still high, and that emotional problems are not an excuse.
It's not just blood that's flowing, it's the uterus that's falling apart.
The inner membrane of the uterus is thinest at the end of menstruation, and then slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the inner membrane thickens) to welcome guests, guests do not come, all are removed (menstrual discharge) next month a new house is built, and the week begins again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, bleeding for several decades, every few days 24 hours, but also abdominal pain and back pain, who wants?
But a man can be born because his mother has had a menstrual period, and the menstrual period is to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, and everyone should thank their mother for having a regular and healthy menstrual period.
In the past, a lot of women's things were suppressed, society gave women brainwashing is said to be dirty, shameful, everyone thought that is so, but the times have changed.
If someone feels menstrual nausea, feels that the woman's body is preparing for the birth of life nausea, shouldn't it be said in public, girls stand up, don't think about it again, have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful I don't know what kind of attitude, how nice it is to face your mother, how nice it is to want your child?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary pads. They're really useful.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.

"Welcome to Friends".
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than thirty years since the death of our relatives, and especially for the uninterrupted assistance I have extended to my friends at home and abroad in my personal capacity since the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to become household workers.
Your acts of kindness have helped us, these afflicted families, through the most difficult times.
The new cholera epidemic is now sweeping the globe, and most donors have retired by the end of the year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian contributions of the Mothers of Tiananmen, who are so dear to our hearts. This humanitarian relief effort should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Scholars of American Studies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in providing humanitarian aid.
In the course of humanitarian relief efforts, NAACP and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often crossing each other.

Relief funds are often not delivered smoothly into the hands of those in difficulty.
In 1994, Mr. Keating suggested that a special group be set up by the Mother of Tian'anmen to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the Sixty-Four Orphans Education Fund, which has been in operation for 11 years, and in 2009, after all the Sixty-Four Orphans graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the Sixty-Four Orphans Relief Fund, which is still in operation today.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and community donations in 1964, generous contributions from individuals, and support from the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the members of the Sixty-four finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the Sixty-four.
During this period, Human Rights China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's donation is for the benefit of the donors. We are all retired people, and our incomes are not as good as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Mr. Ding's letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the dependants to terminate this project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those comrades who have persisted for many years in offering generous donations and risking their lives to provide humanitarian aid.

If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's best to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you are going to go to the pit in this industry training really is a very good choice, especially for those who are self-restraint and weakness, training is a very good choice.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of the institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before selecting a training institution, it is best to explore the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you're in, all have to do with the industry you're studying or wanting to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have graduated from the computer major, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the most efficient and the lowest cost. Nowadays, many online training organizations online are actually very good, but one study cost is high, two invest more time, basically need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I say these situations, self-study is convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to b station also have a lot of training resources, if you do not find the resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation is also possible.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is advisable to go to training institutions to study, so that the study does not take much effort, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people specialized in answering, in addition to the study planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, after study recommend to the company, so that the job interview later can also save a lot of things.
If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.

My Daily Work
Your request, my service.
Careful service, careful cleanliness, keep beautiful.
The details you care about, Feng Gui housekeeping has helped you to do "clean" as much as I can, to serve the family.
Bao Wan house clean, tree family policy monument, the service is in place, clean to the house.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Crystal lamps may be beautiful, but if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will be darkened. It is only after cleaning that they can shine, and that is how life is
Careful work is the way to succeed, with carefulness to shape exquisite, beautiful seam we are serious.
Give me a chance, you will be satisfied, the quality says it all, because the profession deserves to be trusted, your approval is my most encouragement!
All the activities of the present are not good to do!
But I've always believed that as long as I'm serious, as long as I'm persistent, as long as I'm hard, I'll be better than anybody else, at least I'll always be better than sitting and complaining"!
The plan of the day is to start in the morning, and all good things begin in the morning. I hope you start with happiness, luck, health, and purpose. Start a new day, and stay in a good mood all day. Good morning
As a child, happiness is a thing, and to have it is to be happy; as a grown-up, happiness is a goal, and to achieve it is to be happy; as a grown-up, it is discovered that happiness was originally a mentality, and to understand it is to be happy.
To be the truest and most kind of oneself, act according to your heart, no regrets in this life; life is one way, walk your own way; life is two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful and bright life to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
A lot of times, it's not your ability that's holding you back, it's the courage to face things positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you confront difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Although the right wing has had a period of aspiration in history, it is not long, so it is short because giving a little sunshine will make you shine, drinking a little water will make you sweat; a little aspiration will make you look long into Shu, and if you are attacked, you will lose your hair.
In reality, however, the Right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standards of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I am very concerned about his remarks and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that revolution is unnecessary, and that revolution inevitably leads to social instability, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups are in a muddy mess, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
To change or improve China requires patience and an attitude of responsibility for the country and its citizens. Political speculators are not right-wingers, they are bastards.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party listens to some of the right's speeches and analyzes their ideas when necessary, then the left has no such creation, because what the left wants is the junk the Communist Party has thrown away!
I don't think it's necessary to make a big fuss about the fact that I've recently seen some friends beating up the thieves and beating up the leftists.
Don't try to reason with adulterers and left-wingers. They're all one-sided and irrational.
Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even try to get the thieves and the lunatics to admit it.
This is how I tell my friends: When an anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, when a left-wing lunatic scolds your right-wing dog, it proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but when they grow old, they forget them, or pursue them, and become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually moves farther and farther, even the dragon slaughter juvenile finally becomes the evil dragon.
Left and Right I think generally refers to constraints and freedom, China from the congenital genes of historical culture leads China as a whole should be left-leaning.
At home, the right favours freedom, focuses on efficiency and development, the left favours stronger regulation, and the right favours fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while the conflict between China and the United States, the left-wing is certain, is estimated to last for many years.
I can't understand it, but the compliments are done
I didn't say anything, the flowers were so brave
For the past two years, America’s blockade and siege of Huawei’s chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but has also caused huge losses for “American” companies.
As a direct consequence, the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in reduced R&D expenditure and lower capacity of chip producers, thereby creating a disorderly shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
The “core shortage” has now spread to major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers shutting down production and rising mobile phone prices, affecting almost all industries that use chips.
In an effort to gain autonomy for “chips,” tech giants in more and more countries are moving toward “de-embellishment.”
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the U.S. has recently repeatedly hosted the "chip summit" and invited 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support U.S.-based technology giants, such as the U.S.-based tech giant Intel, which has spent $20 billion in the U.S. state of Arizona to build two crystal processing plants and open up its chip subcontracting business in order to regain its dominance in the chip sector.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the power plant, it was likely to take away the power plant's "job".
This is because, as America’s old tech giant, Intel, which has worked in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large pool of talent and technological reserves, is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TPP.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of积电, did not give a damn.
At the "2021 Masters' Think Tank Forum" held in April of this year, Zhang's words were astonishing, and he said bluntly that he had no qualms about the move to bribe Intel to build a chip replacement factory: "It's quite ironic that Intel is building a chip replacement factory."
Zhang's disdain for Intel's encroachment on the crystalline realm stems from Zhang's bitterness over a dispute with Intel over more than thirty years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of America's manufacturing industry, occupying the world's foremost position, and the world's hegemonic semiconductor giant.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which chips were designed, manufactured, and sealed in a single factory.
However, such a model is overwhelming for some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face enormous production line construction costs that they can only hope to avoid.
In 1984, when Zhang heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it would be possible to establish a factory specializing in the manufacture of crystals.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and Taiwan's accumulated electricity system was born.
The company's main business is focused on the single segment of "crystal processing," which does not involve design, but only provides on-the-job services for the manufacture of crystals.
At that time, the newly founded MP3 player, in front of the giant Intel is small.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought to invest in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that Tai Po was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, obviously some self-esteem very high, disdain Tai Po, resolutely refused to invest in Tai Po.
Zhang Zhongmou also concluded that Intel at the time disliked the service.
I didn't expect to despise the giants of crystal manufacturing services in the past, but now also begin to work as a crystal worker.
Consequently, Zhang Zhongmou found it ironic that Intel entered the Crystal Circle.
Today, the market value of TEV has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of Taiwanese accumulated electricity, Intel naturally also did not dare to firmly defend itself.
Today, the tidal current is already thrusting toward the 3 nm chip, while Intel remains at the 14 nm level seven years ago.
To catch up is not easy.
Let's look at some [strange searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hotspots were randomly selected: the February 2 rise, the rise in the price of goods, the commodity rally, the spread of public opinion formed a wave peak, then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, and if there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump peak again.
They appear to be no different from the evolutionary model of Internet public opinion that has been presented on the official website of the Internet Correspondence Bureau.
What is abnormal public opinion?
A random selection of six hotspots in the same event yields [lonely peak-shaped], [ serrated-shaped], and [cliff-shaped].
There are three types of hotspots: cyclic hotspots, where the topic is on the hotspot list, and cliffs, where the hotspot performs its "function" and receives new tasks and heads off to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the wave valley of another event, the time is no less than a second, it must be the united battalion of sailors received the task of launching a new offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches simultaneously appear on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for popular science, which leads to war, which diverts attention, which influences cognition, which misleads judgement, which inflames emotions, which entangles decision-making, black accounts batch by batch, subsection by subsection fine-tuning operations, almost taking into account all the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to retreat.
Anyone who passes by must leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

What are the differences between laser TV and conventional TV in terms of market positioning?
There are two main differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of their market positioning. One is that the latter is more expensive than the former, while the former is cheaper than the former. The other is that the latter is more expensive than the former.
First, laser television focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the full-fledged market positioning of LCD TV, the laser TV clearly focuses more on the large-screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born of the large-screen.
Currently, most mainstream LCD TVs are between 55 and 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are typically over 75 inches in size, and the largest is over 100 inches, sufficiently satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser television in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140 percent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a rapid pace.
The reason why the big screen market has achieved such good results is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the imaging principle of the diffuse reflection of the laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eye, compared with the back light source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is less.
An ophthalmologist at the Sixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and an ophthalmologist at the Beijing Commonwealth Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data from a rigorous comparison of laser and LCD televisions viewed under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser television does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser television not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the steady decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market today is mostly in the tens of thousands of yuan or more, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
I'm sure it makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not realize.
Due to the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of conventional projection equipment, can realize a large screen experience of 100 inches within a short distance, requires little space, and the mainframe is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
Additionally, the heat output is lower, equipment losses are reduced, and the lifespan of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a question of false demand, but of the products of demand subdivision, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser TV is not the dish of the A.V. player, wanting to take into account both the large screen and the inadequate viewing environment, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing and judging themselves, is afraid to listen to the word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle close-up projector, the laser television, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to attach to the screen, which was not compatible with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a fine-structured fennel curtain is costly, and the 80-inch price is essentially equivalent to a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I especially hate projector manufacturers take diffuse reflection good for the eyes this kind of selling point, please, the light that the eyes can see on the curtain is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes can not see, but the real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Furthermore, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be able to form an image at all.
It is precisely by neglecting the thermal spotting (spotting) effect of high-yield screens, that a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, that it is truly unpleasant.
Buying an umbrella insurance, is it safe?
Umbrella is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
In order to become an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant illegal records in the last three years, the minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and it must have the approval of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very harsh, to sum up is to have the strength, to have the approval of the national authority department of the Banking and Insurance Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should have a good style, as an insurance broker's umbrella insurance, the insured need not doubt too much whether the umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, no insurance company can achieve.
In this respect, it is good, it is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest and Thai Super Mary 5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are both Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not doubt its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of the business network point, and the cost of the business staff, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the premium pressure of the insured, while at the same time can leverage the insurance leverage to the maximum.
This is still a very good point.
Consider it.
This is especially important because insurance is a very specialized industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, this can lead to a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring, feel that they are healthy or compliant, so it is easy to have a lot of hidden risks to settle claims, the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the umbrella, also an Internet insurance broker platform) very responsibly tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, the unreliable is people, Internet channels have no professional employees, and there are many sales misleading.
These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are easy to avoid, do not tell the policyholders, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal fee, dozens to 200, etc., many customers withhold a charge for one or two years to buy themselves is not clear.
Thinking it could cost one dollar, the insurance company paid six million (the world lost pie).
To send a mobile phone free of charge, it is the end of the policy number such as 6666,8888 such a special policy number section sent, and if the winning text message is sent, I do not exchange, and no one reminded.
(This is another pitfall for the insurer) to get 60,000 bad health insurance free of charge, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial risks, in the event of a real bad health, 60,000 can do nothing, can not solve the problem, later life begins to run bare.
The country has also been hit hard by misleading sales of Internet-based insurance.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the operators.

I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting off-line products, saving everyone 2000-3000 yuan / year in insurance premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I:Mingya insurance broker, have had 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serve over 1,000 enterprise users, cooperate with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's requirement, customize the insurance products for the customer, among the insured, for the customer's goods, try my best to obtain the best verification results for the customer, after insuring, do the policy arrangement for the customer, the policy custody, let the customer feel at ease.
Grow up with every client for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insurer can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ritual" and may not even have printed paper contracts, this does not in any way affect the validity and legality of electronic contracts.
This model is a bit like a typical "telephone sales" plumbing operation, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we think carefully about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services for many years to come?
From time immemorial, I have opposed all forms of defamation and abuse, and I cannot accept such acts of physical assault.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this scoundrel.
If you don't look at the parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From when you started asking for friends on Facebook, to when you started posting flirtatious posts, to when you tried to post my so-called home address and father's name on social media, I have responded in a non-responsive manner.
You went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Later, I received a number of comments from friends about your face, a photo of you on a friend's profile, and sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news of the police, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more vociferous.
I don't care what your political background is, no matter what your status, in our society, there is a need for respect between the sexes.
Yes, you can continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your drawing, or you can continue to make all kinds of offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don'
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let others humiliate her so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said okay, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in business, it is only those who have no basic morals who choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that honesty is inherent in people.
I intercepted a part of the message for everyone to comment on
Your own post shouldn't be faked by anyone
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization
she's smiling.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. naval arsenal has rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indian region, according to a new satellite image showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
On 9 January, the satellite spotted the U.S. carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabagh Strait, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Strait of Malabar, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first chain of islands in the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This was Carrier Carl Vinson's first deployment with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Sea Eagle cargo aircraft.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln departed from the United States on 3 January.
Lincoln also flew the F-35C Carrier Squadron for the first time, which was part of the 314th Fighter Strike Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan based in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser HMS Lake Champlain and the missile destroyer HMS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. Navy's CMV-22B aircraft carrier flew its route to Guam.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend, CNN reported.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Analysts say the visit sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
China's Most Powerful Weapons Rarely Visit Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows Yongxiao Island in Nansha Islands, China.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness for war, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indian region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunderbolt submarines in the U.S. Navy are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines have made the Thunderbolt one of the "most important surviving weapons in the nuclear triad", a system that includes well-launched ballistic missiles in the United States and bombers with nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to a friend about the recent 26 per cent drop in the value of Meta and its $251 billion depreciation, Zuckerberg said he was "confronted with unprecedented competition" and why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue is mainly from advertising, now today's profitable advertising company, has its own traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps external to Meta's advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is implemented.
But times have changed.
First, due to changes in Apple's privacy policy, Meta no longer has access to users' data, affecting the effectiveness of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly indicating whether the app allows users to access their information, and most people's normal reaction must be no.
If Google strikes again, the impact on Meta's revenues will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is generally known that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, Meta receives at least 10% of its revenue from China, mainly from companies in the maritime sector.
Meta has about a hundred offices in Hong Kong and several large agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an inescapable advertising channel. Most of the money they burned went to Meta.
Interestingly, TT bytes are now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years Meta has made a lot of money from bytes.
All the agencies in the country are helping bytes to Meta there to advertise, Meta Greater China region also performs very well.
I haven't really looked into it lately, but I'm sure it won't be any better than before.
The era of large-scale money laundering by Chinese companies overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels has not gone smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a fall in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don't just look at middle-income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not sufficient.
In order to tell a new story to the market Zuckerberg talked about the original universe.
Meta really should be one of the directions of the future, but it has a longer implementation cycle, and this story shouldn't be enough to support Meta's market capitalization in the next two to three years.
So the next two years are going to be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook, which is so glamorous and makes $100 billion to $200 billion a year. In fact, Facebook is so crisis-ridden that it doesn't have much of a safe haven compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now more expensive and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., faced with the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has little confidence, subverting between is a blink of an eye.
So Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and continuously looking for new tracks, but I think his track selection is wrong, it is an irreversible path.
