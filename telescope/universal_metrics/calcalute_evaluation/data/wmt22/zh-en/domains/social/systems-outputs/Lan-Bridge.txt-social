First of all, I personally think Four Seas is an all-round bad movie, in all senses.
But if the movie doesn't have any highlights, it's not at least a good match.
There are many kinds of bad movies, including those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema and those that make you feel indignant after watching. The Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Han was really talented.
The most painful part of this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, hard to name, with many loopholes like a windbreaker suited on brother Ma.
You may even wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's start with some of the things that I can't understand.
The hero should live on an island in the south and live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
The elderly in a van see the snow from south to northeast?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
And then there was no story about the old man.
How did the heroine and her brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gangsters on the island easily lockdown a mountain road??
Then the truck that sent the rebar in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and there was no truck driver around.
This is so obvious.
Why would a gangster with bad credit and suspicion of illegality become an auxiliary policeman?
Why don't you call the police in the face of usurious loans, and the police in the movie also asked if he got some problems?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but he doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel. Then he was required that he couldn't find the hotel owner and sat outside the room door and slept for a whole night.
This inexplicable plot fills the film, because the plot is so outrageous that I can recall them in pain.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or the fact that the film has no theme at all, is an abominable stitch.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. More than 20 minutes later, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a feature film that wants to reflect the survival of the young people in the town. After watching it, you don't know what you have seen at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy such a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle rider, you can tell the audience how a talented rookie can succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, tell the truth about the stories between a young man who like to ride motorcycles and a waitresses .
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not contain things which are contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zhengyan's new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), so you can't open some brains that even Kennedy can't bear to see.
As for the fact that the heroine is not mentally disabled but acts like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know whether it is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I wonder why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on adding a crash plot to his own movie.
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival to add to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it cannot be distinguished, the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than cheap beats. This kind of "primary racket" is actually industrial waste.
They are at a very low-intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot resist, even a master player will find it difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is --- Tennis is so hard, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you don't want to buy expensive, you can't play twice, and you won't play again, so this racket is cheap, and you don't care.
When you can really tell good from bad, it means that you have improved, and then come to me to buy expensive, I make money twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand better racket at a similar price, such as prince or Deng Lupu. The two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets cannot be sold at a high price. New rackets of RMB 500 and RMB 600 are good, while second-hand rackets of RMB 200 are not. Isn't it good to have a racket of RMB 1,000?
It's friendly to novices, but it's hard to pass the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What was the hottest in 2021?
It's definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was an article named "Look! "Project Managers Can Attack Gold Medal Olympic Projects" is a very popular article, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can compete with them: It is the daily routine of project managers to move bricks, go on business trips and stay up late, and it is even more difficult for them to fight fire, carry on business and apologize.
An article that seems to be joking also shows the daily sorrows of project managers, which means that they are unable to do the current project management work.
And the personnel engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma of work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP applicants, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants in China, about 420,000 PMP® certified applicants and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply take the previous "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment lets us know that we should learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP ensure smooth project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points such as ten major fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when it comes to project management.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: poor cognition of project management, simple reliance on personal experience, lack of project management theory and no idea how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to be implemented in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delay of projects; unclear division of labor among members, unclear "old Youtiao" in the team, unsmooth cross-departmental assistance and communication, and difficulty in promoting projects ...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has won the honorary titles such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", came with the online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
Online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results with lower cost and less investment.
If there is no evidence, you can first see how other trainees evaluate this course: this course is not only provided by Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (former Huawei R&D management team), but also provides in-depth and simple professional explanation of the course content in combination with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods and rich template forms to help trainees convert what they have learned into specific work after class.
It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This time our team brings you this car that is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million rmb, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand rmb, four-wheel drive, why called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably the case with myvi.
The low body, the arrogant scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine, which offers a panoramic view of the glass, which perfectly illustrate the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the car model. Just google it by yourself. The editor sorted out some comments that google may not give!
Too much attention. Everyone was watching wherever they went. It was uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
The fuel cost per 1 km is about RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting on and off the car, or it will be a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf immediately after getting off the car. (But it's still cool)
The car body is too large, so parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, afraid of being knocked when the next car door is opened!
It's a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road(The editor speaks for himself, has nothing to do with the owner of the car, haha).
Don't get me wrong. The supercar is not for sale. Sorry!
Friends who want to video your car, please contact us!
More auto information you don't know is in The Car Guide / People's Auto Guide
The accident is worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that everyone knows that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
Just a few minutes ago, a foreign country hit a million sports cars 911 and ten million supercars Chiron!
Look at the results, expensive for a reason!
At a time when NFT emerged, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn stable incomes.
Axie Infinity is a pet-growing game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various games such as NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest turnover at present, and has exceeded USD 3 billion so far.
According to data from TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to the Honor of Kings.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity conveys a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players can no longer be a single character, but can participate in the governance of the game ecology in addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but by blockchain technology.
When I read a piece of news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is that enterprises should first choose industries with large growth potential, at least more than RMB 100bn in market size, and then choose industries with good future growth potential, considering the industries with the best growth potential in the next 3-5 years, and finally choose industries supported by policies.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", that is, do the things right.
And strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding the direction, tactics lies in landing, and there is room for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on the basis of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on the basis of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On top of improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; Based on the improvement of DAU (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin met several milestones events in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as the legal currency, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the United States Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking another expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure as the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landed on the United States capital market.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr.Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory building was located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site visits, Lu Xiansheng decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr.Lu negotiated with Lin Mou, the owner's family, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted RMB 200,000 as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin Mou signed the Receipt for Plant Sales Deposit as the payee, which stated: "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit shall be paid by the seller. If the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double, and both parties agree to sign the plant sales contract within one week."
However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the sales scope and payment method of the plant, the housing sales contract was delayed.
Considering that both parties could not reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, several days later, Lin Mou returned the deposit of RMB 200,000 to Mr.Lu.
Mr.Lu was helpless and angry when he finally paid the deposit and the house payment was ready, and the seller refused to sell the house.
Therefore, Mr.Lu sued Lin Mou to the People's Court of Yuyao.
After hearing, the court held that the parties finally failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be attributed to the defendant alone and should be reasonably presumed to be a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the down payment penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the down payment.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from lawyers] Necessary duty of care shall be exercised in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer shall fulfill the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian. This is the second week you moved to Japan.
When you walk down the street, you suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear, and finally you run.
"Miss! Please wait!" You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. You look beautiful. Are you interested in reality shows?"
You're confused, afraid that it's a scam.
He gave you a business card and you found out that he was really the director of a big entertainment company in Japan.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk about it. The remuneration must be indispensable."
You confusedly came to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street at a glance. He really wanted you to come.
Thinking that there was no loss, and you could make money, and you signed the contract.
It's a big love reality show divided into two parts.
In the early stage, stars and amateurs will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.
Later, they will enter the game and break through the stage together.
With the official recording starting next week, you don't really know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen.
I accidentally read the following article, discussing why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following article may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same.
So you're sure to ask: Why is the shelf life one year for bags and two years or more for cans?
Or ask: why is the price difference so big between bagged and canned milk powder?
From this point of view, many consumers or moms think that the quality is much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who say that the taste or flavor is different after eating!
Now let me tell you the reason why it is expensive to pretend to be expensive.
Why is the price difference so big for the same raw materials?
Most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high to be accepted by consumers, which means the profit margin of manufacturers is very low or there is no profit. How can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, the price of canonical costumes has increased significantly to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging rather than bagged packaging.
How come so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of RMB on advertising every year?
You can imagine that.
With the development of the society, the marketing expenses, such as promotion personnel, display expenses, gift expenses and advertising expenses, are also increasing.
So various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products which is the canned one, and its price is also rising, in fact, this is caused by the increase in market costs out of the new products.
The main purpose is to make higher profits. In fact, the cost of raw materials will not exceed RMB 3 or RMB 4.
In addition, in order to promote their products, some brands resort to the help of doctors in hospitals to promote their products, with profits ranging from RMB 30 to RMB 80.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow this method of operation, in fact, this method is to harm consumers.
It is suggested that you buy bagged milk powder into cans on the premise that there are cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
In addition, people should not think that the shelf life of canned packaging is longer than that of bagged packaging. If the shelf life of canned packaging is the same as that of bagged packaging after unpacking, it is just that the bagged packaging is not easy to store and is easy to deteriorate due to moisture.
I just saw an article about writing a stunt. It's too long.
I'm going to popularize the science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual break one day between the ages of 13 and 15, with amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, they will come here regularly once a month.
However, it is not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. The travel time is about a week, so it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, it won't follow the schedule due to bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days and some people have one week; some people have fewer abortions and some people have great hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, and some people are transported away by ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change with time. Previously, pain did not mean lifetime pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours from the beginning to the end of the day, and all you can do is use a sanitary napkin or tampon to prevent blood from flowing to your clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. It is not necessary to take ibuprofen immediately before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of the menstrual period, which can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take ibuprofen again after dysmenorrhea starts.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, diarrhea is easy.
If it is about the end of the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, basically two days will come to menstruation.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to change it six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If the portion prepared in advance is added, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify here. Tampons do not need to be changed frequently. They can be changed every five or six hours, eight hours in maximum)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will trip you.
But official crime data show that women's ability to control their emotions is high, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's shedding endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. The house is built every month (the endometrium becomes thicker) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, they will be demolished (the menstruation is expelled) and a new house will be built next month, which will repeat again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a month, abdominal pain and low back pain, who would like that?
But a person can be born because his mother has come to menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you to come to this world for the first time to live in a 10-month house, everyone to thank their mother regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women as dirty and shameful. People thought that was the case, but the time has changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is nauseous and that the woman's body is disgusting about the preparations for giving birth to life, they should not speak out in public. Girls should stand up and don't think so. They have never experienced it before, nor will they experience it in their life. Men who do not know much about it should not be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can they face their mother and how can they give birth to their child with such a attitude?
Finally, the sisters try the tampon. It works.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy and aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase “The metaphysical is spiritual, the physical is carnal” in the Book of Changes Xi Ci I, which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended problems.
The ontology is "to study which nouns represent the real existence of entities and which nouns represent mere concepts".
Metaphysical naturalism means denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, which is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodology Naturalism refers to research methods  without considering god.
Spiritual philosophy is a philosophical branch that studies consciousness and the nature of their relationship to the body（especially the brain）.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between the mind and the body".
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that discusses the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the subject of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behaviors).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (application of ethical theory to academics of actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics(collection of information about how people live, summarizing from the observed style).
Its examination of ethics is not based on the expected theory, but on the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice. It discusses the ethics held by social ethnic groups).
The history of ethics includes Roman ethics in Greece and Christian ethics in the Middle Ages.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vara and montaigne.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance that you have provided over the course of more than 30 years since the death of our relatives, especially since I personally appealed to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the old parents of most of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up to work.
It's your righteousness that has helped us families through the hardest times.
At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most of the donors are now in their retirement years.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donation to the group of mothers in Tiananmen, which should have drawn a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand!
Please accept my best wishes.
Tao Ye'an:please  allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Salvage money is often not delivered smoothly to the relatives of  June 4th Incident victimis.
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Mr.Ding, a special team was set up by "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphan Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the June 4th Orphans Special Poverty Alleviation Fund for Lonely Old People , which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th Incident,from generous contributions of individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of the sister universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was only last year, after 31 years, that the families of the June 4th Incident victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4th incident.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the  donation for the sake of the donors, and  we are indeed retired seniors whose income is not as abundant as before we retired. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends.
We will respect the decisions of victims' relatives, terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to our chivalrous colleagues who have been generously and riskily delivering humaitarian aid over the years,
A programming rookie who wants to share personal experiences.
If you want to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training. But if you don't have such an idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot and takes six months to learn.
However, training is indeed a good choice for those who intend to enter this industry, especially for those with weak self-control. Training is a perfect choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, it depends on the faculty of the training institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is meaningless. Of course, some new training institutions are not very strong in faculty.
Second, before choosing a training institution, it is better to inquire about the students of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you didn't give a certain introduction about yourself. Learnig has a lot to do with personal situation.
Things like major, age, the language you want to study, and even the city you are in will all be relevant to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or you have graduated from the computer major, I personally suggest that you study by yourself if you have enough time. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Many offline and online training institutions are also doing well. However, first, the learning cost is high, and second, the time invested is relatively long, which basically requires centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient.  Many online learning resources are free, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, some classic books can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not majoring in computer, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. In this way, it is not very difficult to learn. The teacher explains it in detail, there are also people dedicated to answer questions.In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements and there are internal promotion quota. After the training, you can be  recommended to the company,so that the later job interview process can also save a lot of things
These are my opinions. As I said earlier, I don't know your situation, so I only give a general introduction and don't give you a detailed introduction. If there is anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted furnace water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional seaming, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently liked me, working hard for life  Life is tired but you have to continue.
Life will not disappoint every hard-working people. If you like me,just to follow me. Thanks to those who silently like me.
Life is like this. Others only care about the results and you support yourself in the process. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue.We can look back but cannot go back...
Cleaning is work and responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of attention.
Although we do the dirtiest work,we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude.When we see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort eventually pays off!
My daily work
- Your request, my service.

Only by doing it with heart can we succeed. We are serious about shaping exquisiteness with care.
Give me a chance, which will make you satisfied. Quality explains everything,  our professional deserves to be trsted, your recognition is the encouragement!
It's hard for all walks of life!
But I always believe that as long as I'm serious, persistent and hard-working, I'll be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The plan of a day is to start in the morning. All the good things start in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good wishes. Keep a good mood all day. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I reached it; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and I was happy when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; There are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, keeping them till the old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Very often, what binds you is not the ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, you'd better face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to difficulties, the problems will eventually be solved.
Although the rightists had succeeded in history,but not for a long time,because they became greedy when they got small benefits；The more they got,the more they wanted,and once they were attacked, they didn't know where they should go.
But to be honest, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied from the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
III. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much. Because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his theory of anti-communism. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth，changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make money from political speculation are not Rightists, but bastards.
Let's talk about left.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
Five，recently, I saw some friends refuting the leftists while resisting the anti thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and leftists. They are both unreasonable.
Do not try to prove that we are right, let alone let the rebels and leftists admit it, why bother？
I tell my friends : when the rebels call you toadies, when the leftists call you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are teenagers. When they grow old, they forget or pursue dreams, but become paranoid.
He had gone far away from his ideal,and even, the past dragon slaughterer eventually became the evil dragon.
As far as I'm concerned, "left and right" generally refers to "constraint" and "freedom". In China, the innate genes of history and culture lead to a left-sided situation.
Domestic rightists are free, focusing on efficiency and development, while leftists are more regulated, focusing more on equity and security.
At present, the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States compete with each other. It is certain that the left side will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll just like it.
Don't say anything,Hua Hua is such a loyal friend
In the past two years, America's blockade and containment of Huawei chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The American empire suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and related enterprises of its allies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of automobile enterprises and the price rise of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", tech giants in more and more countries have begun to "de-Americanized".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves to host the "Chip Summit". It has also invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, Intel, a time-honored technology giant of the United States, invested USD 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened chip OEM business to the outside world in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field.
When most people think that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC and is likely to take TSMC's "job".
The reason why they are so sure is that,as a long-established technology giant of the American empire, Intel has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in a short time and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou spoke surprisingly. Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly that it was quite ironic for Intel to build a wafer factory.
Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer space because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of American Empire's manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world and the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, packaged and tested by a factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model made some small enterprises unable to bear the heavy burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to face the huge cost of production line construction, they could only flinch.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to work together in the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he believed that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongmou's vision came true and TSMC came into being.
TSMC's main business is aimed at the single link of "wafer processing". It does not design but only provides OEM services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously regarded itself very highly, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down  on the wafer fabrication service at that time.
No one could imagine that  the giant who looked down upon the wafer manufacturing service in the past would also start to  work as a foundry now.
So, Zhang Zhongmou feels ironic about Intel's entry into wafer foundry.
TSMC's market capitalisation has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with the strong attack of TSMC, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards a 3nm chip, while Intel remains at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Today, let's take a look at some [strange trending topics].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three trending topics:the Longtaitou Festival  on the second day of the second month, the price rise of Orion,and the Huolala incident. The public opinion spread and formes a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally disappeared. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look exactly the same as the [network public opinion evolution model] shown on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six trending topics from the same event are randomly selected, showing [isolated shape], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Isolated peak] refers to people hype things purposely,which quickly rushes to the trending topic list and attracts public attention;[jagged shape] refers to hype events periodicly, which ensures that the topic is on the trending topic list;  [cliff shape] refers to collective evacuation, that is, the  trending topic succeeds playing its "role" , receives new tasks and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is  not a minute difference. It must be that a unified group of online supporters receive the mission and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of Gangsterdom PR is evident: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time,which to attract attention,  which are responsible for science popularization, which arouse controversies, which divert attention, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions and which coerce decisions.The  gangsterdom accounts carry out fine operations in batches and nodes, almost considering all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Apart from all subjective factors such as position and emotion, gangsterdom public relations will have nowhere to hide from objective data alone.
Everything will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned in the topic should refer to LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs in the world have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CEC's forecast, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is less.
Ophthalmologists from CISI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative test of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye-protection properties and even improve in certain aspects.
At present, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of laser TVs on the market is mostly above RMB 10,000. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can realize a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
Plus lower heat generation, less wear and tear on equipment, and longer TV life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high definition image quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring users more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo demand, but a product of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio and video players. If they want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, they can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, they can judge by themselves, afraid of listening to what they say.
Briefly, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the Fresnel curtain with microstructure is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be changed to 65 inches liquid crystal.
In addition, I especially hate that projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection as a selling point. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. If you want to be more serious, the LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light". If you open the TV ceiling, it will also be illuminated.
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot be imaged at all.
Ignoring the hot-spot (spot) effect of the high-gain curtain, it is really uncomfortable that a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at an angle.
Is it reliable to buy insurance in xiaoyusan.com?
Xiaoyushan is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Amendment) tips,  three keywords must be met  to become an insurance brokerage company:shareholders and sponsors who have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC.
The three rules are harsh. To sum up, insurance companies need to be competent, approved by the national authorities of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country) and have a good style of work. As insurance brokers, insurance applicants don't need to question whether the umbrella insurance is formal. After all, not all insurance companies can meet the three thresholds.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies sell their star critical illness insurance on this platform. For example, the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance, both the claim settler and the underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party agency, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment model, the products of the Internet platform are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the salary cost of salespersons. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of insurance applicants and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of salesmen, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry with very high professionalism requirements. Many Internet product customers can buy insurance by themselves, which has many misunderstandings. In terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when buying insurance and feel that they are healthy or conform to the requirements, which is easy to have many hidden dangers of claim settlement and may be rejected.
I once did insurance telemarketing in "Tencent WeSure" (like Xiaoyuguan, also an online insurance brokerage platform) and told everyone very responsiblely.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, and the unreliable is people. There are no professional practitioners in internet channels, and there are also many sales misleading.
For example, RMB 1 for insurance of RMB 6 million, free mobile phones for buying insurance, and free sum insured for critical illness of RMB 60,000. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid the serious ones and will not tell the policy holder. The first month is RMB 1, and the next month is charged according to the normal rate, ranging from dozens to RMB 200. Many customers do not know what they buy for one or two years.
I thought I could spend $1 and the insurance company would pay 6 million.（pennies from the heaven）
Free mobile phones are given only for special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If a winning short message is sent,  you do not redeem it and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for insurance applicants.) It is a short-term free sum insured for critical illnesses of 60,000 yuan. If you rely only on this and there is no other commercial insurance, what can you do if you really have a critical illness? If the problem cannot be solved, your future life will start running naked.
At present, the state is cracking down on the misleading of online insurance sales.
On the whole, there is no problem with platforms and products. The problem lies in the professionalism and professional ethics of salespersons.
It is suggested that the topic should be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers cover offline products, saving RMB 2,000-3,000/year for each person.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I: Minya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on their needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will sort out and trust insurance policies for customers, so that customers can be assured.
Grow with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the thread starter！
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, online insurance means that insurance applicants can independently complete all insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policy holder and the insurance consultant do not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policy holder itself.
Although there is no "sense of ceremony" in the application of internet insurance, and there may even be no printed contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the "telemarketing" general assembly line, but buying insurance like this also has a fatal problem, that is -- subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us many years later?
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such physical attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you have to resist first.
I've taken a non-responsive attitude since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting funny posts, and then trying to post my home location and father's name on social media.
You're not just going to tag me at the rate of six meals a day, but you're going to talk to your so-called friends on Facebook about my privacy, humiliating remarks about my appearance and figure, holding that I am easy to be pregnant, and talking about love bite in bed, whether to insert or not, and I...ignore.
But then I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and comments of sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After the news that I called the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, or what status you are. In our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue this ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, insulting remark, you can also continue to say that you just care and follow me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yeah, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let others humiliate herself so much to become famous.
My friend asked me if I was okay.
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice naturally inhabits man's heart
I give you some screenshots that you can comment
Your own posting should not be able to be impersonated
I can only say that you are a civilized public enemy
A smile from the heart
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China  Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17  Multidimensional Pro-CCP Media Multidimensional Report:China-U.S. Relations Update: The latest satellite image shows that three United States aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the United States naval arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending important signals to allies and adversaries of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a think tank in China, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Balabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea,is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Ospreys.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on 3 January, is now on the Pacific Ocean.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carries a squadron of F-35Cs, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the above two carriers, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region on the USS Ronald Reagan docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier strike group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stokdal.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The United States Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating the United States' ability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "thunder submarines" in the United States naval fleet are generally kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad", a system that also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located in the continental United States and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
I was talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and $251 billion market value evaporation.  Zuckerberg responded to why [facing unprecedented competition].
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising company has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever the functional orientation, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Moreover, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps connect to Meta's advertising, and realizable value can be attained through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow Apps to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reactions are definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google makes another move, it would have a greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
As we all know, Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in overseas business in China.
Meta has around a few hundred people in its offices in Hong Kong and several agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they invested is given to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance two years ago.
Domestic agencies are helping ByteDance advertise on Meta, and Meta Greater China also performs well.
I don't know much about it recently, but it's definitely not as good as before.
The stage of massive cash-burning overseas by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not just about income, but more importantly about future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are insufficient.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg said, "The metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in the past two to three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta will have a tough time.
Although Facebook enjoys reputation now and has a huge  revenue of USD 100bn-200bn every year, it has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, Facebook has no good security barrier.
Although some of its social apps, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, have high DAUs, Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok. Subversion can happen between the blink of an eye.
The metaverse is an unreachable concept, and there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong and it is a non-return path. The above is my thoughts for reference.
