Let's start with the conclusion. Personally, I think “All Seas” is an all-round bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you want to say whether this movie has a highlight or not, then it's not at least the soundtrack selection is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It's one that allows you to sleep soundly in a movie theater, and one that fills you with anger after watching it. “All Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
What makes people feel the most painful about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a Gram novel. It's hard to name, and has many loopholes like a trench coat on Brother Pony's body.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of poop.
First, let's briefly talk about some of the episodes that I find difficult to understand.
The male owner's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to watch the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then this old man didn't have the following.
How did the hostess get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the little bastards of the Island Speed Party easily close a section of mountain road??
Then the truck that sent the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't find it around.
The feeling of this prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small mixed speed party with no credit information and be suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of why usury loans didn't call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges that he can't find the hotel owner and sleep outside the door of his room for a night's sleep?
This inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and it pains me when the plot is so outrageous that I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main theme of the movie, or the movie doesn't have a main theme at all, which is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through watching it, you thought it might be a drama film that wanted to reflect the hard survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you didn't know exactly what you watched at all. With that, you had deep doubts about yourself, why should you go to the cinema to enjoy poop during the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to film a motorcyclist, then inspiration+comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeded step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then honestly talk about the grudges between young people in town who like to ride motorcycles and waiter girls.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yoon Jung, whose new motorcycle was burned, and then he was able to sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that Kennedy couldn't even stop watching.
As for the heroine who is clearly not mentally retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Also, I really don't understand why Han Han, as a racer, is so keen to add crash episodes to his own movies?
Are movies like this scheduled in the Spring Festival program to add blockages to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a practitioner at a similar price first.
It's not friendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell, then the normal situation that is expensive will be more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of “starter shot” is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the beat, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot be topped, and it is difficult for a master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is — tennis is so difficult. I know if you can't learn it, and I also know that you can't bear to buy expensive ones and fool you with a bargain. If you play twice, you won't play again. So this beat is cheap, and you don't feel distressed either.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have progressed. When the time comes, you will come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand racket at a similar price, and choose Prince or Dunlop's. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't be sold for a price either. A new 500 or 600 would be fine. A second-hand 200 yuan, isn't it pleasant to have a 1,000 yuan racket?
It's very friendly to newbies, but as soon as they pass the novice stage, they have chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article called “Quick Look! The article “Olympic Games Where Project Managers Can Hit Gold Medals” is very popular. It mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects. No one can match it: moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late is a daily routine for project managers. Fighting fires, carrying pots, and apologizing is not a problem.
An article that seemed like a joke and ridicule also revealed the daily bitterness of project managers. Behind it, it represented a lack of effort in the current project management work.
And people working in project management are also gradually choosing to get themselves out of trouble at work through some actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional) applicants each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the “China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)”, as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified about 420,000, and the number of valid licensees was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® licenses worldwide.
The number of PMP licensees has increased year by year in the past 10 years, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to simply copy past “old experience” to do things. The rapidly changing work environment tells us that we need to learn and stand on the shoulders of science giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that project management is smooth and unhindered?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the relevant knowledge points such as the top ten areas of project management and the five major process groups, but it is still a mess when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: poor project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, no idea how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, inability to land in the work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, project delays; unclear division of labor among members, “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with poor cross-departmental assistance communication , the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won honorary titles such as “China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base”, came with the “R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp” online course.
The “R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp” online course is an online fragmented learning method that combines practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
If you don't have a certificate in speaking, you can first take a look at how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only an in-depth and professional explanation of the course content by Zhongtian Huaxia's expert team (formerly Huawei's R&D management team), combined with internationally advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students apply the content transformation they learn to specific tasks after class.
It is claimed that the Xinshan District Super Run has the loudest exhaust sound!
The car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship super car, Murcielago's replacement model — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is close to MYR 2 million. A year's road tax is ten thousand MYR. It's four-wheel drive. Why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, if you forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. Probably Xiaobian's MyVI will reach 100km/h when it's 30km/h, huh.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine with unobstructed views under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say much about the car model description. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
It's so much attention that everyone is watching everywhere they go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit cool)
The cost of 1 km of fuel is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still cool)
The car body is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid the car next door will knock when it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run in this video isn't going to be sold, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!

It led to a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I'm sure riders all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 is also priced at one million!
A few days ago, in just a few minutes, a million sports cars were knocked out abroad, 911, and tens of millions of super cars, Chiron!
Looking at the results, it makes sense that it's expensive!
At a time when NFTs are rapidly coming out of the loop, a new concept has popped up in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called “Axie Infinity” had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn a stable income from the game.
“Axie Infinity” is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology. It combines a variety of ways to play, including NFTs. It is currently the most traded NFT project, exceeding US$3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than US$8.2 million a day, directly forcing “King's Glory”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of “Axie Infinity” will pass on a new “palytoearn” model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character. In addition to being able to get fun and financial benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of the target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion dollars; secondly, choose an industry with good growth in the future, consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to “do the things right”, that is, to do things right.
The strategy is to “do the right thing”, that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, in addition to how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or expanding horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on top of increasing customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to improving event participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right event KPI to achieve the right Campaign goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new ones; in addition to improving DAU (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin legal tender. This is the first time Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved Proshares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market, and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin implemented a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which increases the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduces the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the plant, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the “Plant Sales Deposit Receipt”, which states, “If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. The two parties agree to sign a contract for the sale and sale of the plant within one week.”
However, since then, the two sides failed to agree on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the plant and the payment method, etc., which led to delays in signing the housing sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
When the deposit was paid and the housing payment was ready, it was almost impossible to sign the contract “on the doorstep”, but the seller didn't sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After the hearing, the court found that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not be attributed only to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had not been successful. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant was not liable for breach of contract for double the return of the deposit.
After the verdict in the first instance, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
[Lawyer Reminder] Necessary duty of caution should be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer must exercise the necessary duty of due diligence, for example, to verify the information on the owner of the house and whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian. This is the second week you moved to Japan.
You walk down the street and suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear, and finally run up.
The man chased behind you: “Miss! Please wait!” (Full Japanese conversation) You stopped in front of a convenience store.
“Miss... I'm a director. I think you're beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?”
You're very puzzled and afraid this is a scam.
He stuffed you a business card, and you found out that he was really the director of a major Japanese entertainment company.
“Miss, if we have time, we can go to the company to talk. The film must be paid.”
When you were confused, you came to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street at a glance and really wanted you to come and participate.
I signed a contract thinking that there was no loss and that I could still make money.
It's a big romance reality show, and it's split into two parts.
The early stages will allow stars and amateurs to get along in real life and cultivate tacit agreement.
Later, they will enter the game to break through the level together.
The official recording will start next week. You don't know who your partner will be, and what interesting things will happen?
I accidentally saw something like the following article. From a commercial point of view and from the perspective of the shelf life, why this customer wants a logistics company in the free trade zone to help with canning. Although canning is deep processing, it is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text here may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the ingredients in the bag are exactly the same as the milk powder in the bag, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while a hearing bag has a shelf life of two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating it out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the dress is not the same!
Now let me tell you the reason why it's expensive to listen to it. Where is it expensive?
Why is there such a big difference in price when they have the same raw materials?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have had a big increase in the pricing of listening outfits to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening packs rather than bags.
Also, you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine, everyone knows.
Well, with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, for example: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display fees, product giveaways, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and they are listening, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that has come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, use no means to link up with doctors in hospitals. They assist in the promotion of their products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from the first hearing.
However, the relevant laws of China absolutely do not allow such methods and methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder in bags and put them in cans on the premise that you have a can at home, so you can save money, and increase the storage and tightness of milk powder, and have no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of a hearing bag is longer than that of a bag. If the shelf life of a hearing bag is the same as that of a bag after opening the package, it's just that the bag is not easy to store after opening the bag, and it is easy to deteriorate from moisture.
I just saw an article about an official holiday, which is too long.
Give science popularization to men you don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first official holiday on one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will do it more regularly once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to accurately predict. Tolerances of about a week need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes poor luck rolls over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some have little flow, some have severe blood loss; some have little reaction, some have pain to be taken away by an ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. No pain before meant no pain for the rest of your life.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours in a few days from the beginning to the end. The only thing you can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent blood from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. Eating ibuprofen quickly when dysmenorrhea has not had time at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat it after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before menstruation due to uterine hyperemia and excessive prostaglandin release.
If I'm about to reach my cycle, I have diarrhea inexplicably, and basically menstruation will come within 2 days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins once every two or three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Revise here. You don't need to change tampons often. You can change them once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal activity during menstruation may be irritable, and during ovulation, emotional instability due to hormonal changes in the body is also very unlucky, and the body stumbles on itself.
However, official crime rate data show that women are still very capable of controlling their emotions, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding endometrium.
The endometrium is the thinnest after menstruation ends, and then it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month a house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. The guests don't come, all of them are removed (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and the weeks go on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, I bleed 24 hours a day every month, and I also had abdominal pain and back pain. Who would like it?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone wants to thank their mother for having menstruation regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is nauseous, feels that the preparation of a woman's body to nurture her life is disgusting, shouldn't be said in the public, girls stand up, don't think this way anymore, have never experienced it in this life, and don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful at any rate, how embarrassed is this attitude to face their own mothers, how embarrassed are they to want their own children?
Finally, let's try tampons, sisters, it's really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the basic laws of philosophy that aim to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation “metaphysics” is taken from the phrase “The Metaphysics Are the Way the Metaphysics Are Said, the Metaphysics Are the Instruments” in “I Ching • The Phrase Uploaded”. It was translated by metaphysics for Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period).
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to “study exactly which nouns represent real existential entities, and which nouns only represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation is that all phenomena can be explained with the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that does not say God
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the physical body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss “the relationship between mind and body.”
The theory of intellectualism is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic reflection and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct endorsed by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various moral views, and suggesting ethical guidelines for correct or wrong behavior.
It studies what type of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (disciplines that apply ethical theories to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collects information about how people live, and summarizes them from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but rather investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents (moral agents), which contributed to all the moral factors of this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Ethical ideas of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: Ethical ideas of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part 3: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative figures: Hume et al., 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire et al., 18-19 century, German academy ethics, Representative figures: Kant and Hegel et al., 18-19 century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sickiewick, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German neo-Kandist ethics, representative figure: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figure: Toledo Mas Hill Green et al.), transition Period ethics (irrational ethics, representative characters: Kirkay Guo Er, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies “principles and standards for effective inference and proof”.
Logic generally consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retroactive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline whose theme is the study of the essence of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted until now.
Nowadays, the elderly parents of the vast majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have also grown up to start families and work.
It was your act of righteousness that helped our families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors have also retired their annual retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of the Tiananmen Square Mother Group, which belongs to us. This humanitarian relief campaign should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love, and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will surely be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the National Federation of American Self-Defense (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the National Federation of Aesthetics and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy are two parallel organizations, and project implementers often cross.

Bailouts are often not delivered smoothly in the hands of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special team was set up by the “Tiananmen Square Mother” to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “64 Orphan Education Fund”. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all 64 orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the “64 Special Hardship Household Relief Fund for the Lonely Elderly”, which has been implemented to this day.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in June 4th, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the 64 victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong raised in the name of 64 that year.
During this period, “Human Rights in China” is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's suspension of the June 4th donation was due to the donor's consideration. We are indeed all retired elderly people, and their income is not as good as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his “To a Friend” letter.
We will respect the decision of those in distress, terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have persisted in giving generously over the years and risked delivering humanitarian aid funds.
A little bit of programming that I want to share my personal experience with.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have an idea about this, it's best to study yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for people with weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, check out this training institution before choosing it. It is best to check out the students who come out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know exactly what the institution is like, and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question when you ask this question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one study cost is high, and the second is a lot of time invested, and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if I were talking about these situations, it would be very convenient to self-study. Nowadays, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are also many training resources when you go to Station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultations.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be studied comprehensively with videos.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study. This way, the study is not very strenuous. The teacher explains it in detail, and there are also people who specifically answer any questions, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend going to the company after studying. In this way, the interview session for finding a job later can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. As I mentioned earlier, because I don't know about your situation, the introduction is not detailed. If you have anything else you want to consult, you can feel free to contact me for communication.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted stove water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional sewing, housekeeping
Thank you to those who silently give me praise. I work hard for life, life is tiring but I have to continue
Life will not live up to everyone's efforts. Pay attention to me if you like it. Thank you to those who silently praise me
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, support the process on their own. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, just continue. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will pay off!
My day-to-day job

Careful service, careful cleaning, and good retention.
For the details you care about, Feng Gui Housekeeping has helped you to be “clean” as much as I can, and serve my family.
Keep Wan's family clean, build a reputation for housekeeping, service in place, and clean home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily job
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull and dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. It can only shine brightly after cleaning, and the same is true of life
If you do it with your heart, you can succeed. Using meticulousness to shape exquisite, beautiful sewing is serious.
Give me a chance and I will definitely satisfy you. The quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
Right now, all walks of life are not doing well!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persevere enough, and work hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining”!
The plan for the day is in the morning. All the beauty starts early in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishful intentions, and keep a good mood all day long Good morning
When I was a kid, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I discovered that happiness turned out to be a mentality, and happiness was understood.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; one path in life, follow your own path; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, beautiful and bright until old age!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges.
Many times, it's not your ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it frankly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
2. Although the right wing has a successful era in history, it is not long, so it is short because if you give it some sunshine, you sweat when you drink some boiling water; if you get a little bit of ambition, you will have to look forward to Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached.
However, seeking truth from facts, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution in defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As far as I'm concerned, even though I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I really care about what he says and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I think the anti-necessity revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, political groups, ichthyosaurs mixed with sediment, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. Changing or improving China requires patience and an attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to get the chestnuts out of the fire with political speculation are not right-wing, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will still listen to some of the remarks made by the right and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this creation, because what the left wants is the bad food thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting Zuo Yi while fighting anti-thieves, and it was quite infuriating. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with traitors or Zuo Mann. They are all children's tendons, and it's unreasonable to say.
Don't try to prove that we're right either, let alone get the anti-thief and Zuo Mann to admit it. Why should it be?
I told my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you Wumao, and when Zuo scolds you for being your right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were teenagers, but when they got old, they forgot their ideals or pursued them, but became paranoid.
It's getting farther away from ideals, and even dragon slayer teenagers eventually become evil dragons.
Left and right, I think it generally means restraint and freedom. China as a whole should be leftist due to the innate genes of history and culture.
On the other hand, the domestic right is free and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the dispute between China and the US is certain to be on the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many
Even if you can't read it, you're done with a like
I'm not saying anything. Flowers and flowers are so righteous
In the past two years, the US emperor's blockade and blockade of Huawei chips has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “American” companies to suffer huge losses.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and demanded that its own companies and allied companies block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing disruptions in the global chip supply chain shortage.
Today, “lack of core” has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies discontinuing production and rising mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly from it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of “chips”, technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to move on the path of “de-beautification”.
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and the United States have recently made frequent moves to host the “chip summit”. They also invited 64 giants to set up a semiconductor alliance and raised funds to support local US technology giants. For example, Intel, an established US imperial technology giant, spent US$20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona in the United States to regain its dominance in the chip field. And open chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely that it will steal TSMC's “job bowl”.
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as an established technology giant in the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves, and will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel's decision.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made an amazing statement. Regarding Intel's move to spend money to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly that Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has always been a jewel in the US imperial manufacturing industry. It is the world's top position and the world's hegemon in the semiconductor field.
Until the 80s of the last century, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. From chip design, manufacturing to sealing and testing, it was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged by the huge cost of building production lines.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to experience a division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were specialized designs, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC emerged.
TSMC targets its main business as a single link in “wafer processing”. It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was a small minion in front of Intel, the Big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou sought investment from Intel. However, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some regarded themselves very highly. They looked down on TSMC and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer processing services at the time.
I didn't expect giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then, but now they also have to start foundry wafers.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thought it was ironic that Intel entered foundry for wafers.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still and proclaim itself.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
It's actually not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some “Strange Hot Searches” today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three popular searches were randomly selected: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the goods rally incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smoothing curve) eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion was generated, a small hump would reappear.
They look no different from the “Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model” once displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six popular searches from the same event were randomly selected, showing [solitary peak], [jagged], and [cliff shape].
[Solitary peak] is artificial heating, which quickly hit the hot list and attracted public attention; [jagged] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is on the hot list; [cliff-shaped] is collective evacuation. The hot search has completed its “function”, received new tasks, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one incident happened to be the valley of another incident. The time was not bad in minutes and seconds. It must have been a unified approval of the Navy to receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popularization, which lead to momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which misleading judgments, which incite emotions, which contain decisions, black property accounts in batches and nodes are refined to fight, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Leaving aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have no place to hide.
Everyone who walks by must leave traces. We will dig up traces like this together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, what the title owner said about traditional televisions should refer to LCD televisions, while the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD televisions are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the fully expanded market positioning of LCD televisions, laser televisions obviously focus more on the large-screen market, or laser televisions themselves are products created for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally 75 inches or more in size, and the largest exceeds 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, laser TVs have been increasing in global shipments and sales, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, the laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and will continue to grow rapidly.
The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser televisions in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eyeball. Compared with the backlight emitting light of an LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation to the eyes is less.
Ophthalmologists from the Saisi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparison tests of people watching laser TVs and LCD televisions under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser televisions do have strong eye protection properties and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, most of the laser TVs on the market are currently priced at more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light sources, prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive to sell?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD televisions and projections.
With ultra-short focal projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. It requires little space, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less loss to equipment, and a longer service life of the TV.
In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audiovisual experience.
I can't talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation. When it comes to picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players. If you want to balance the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. There are pros and cons to everything. You can judge for yourself after weighing it off, and I'm afraid to listen to the words on the side.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors — laser televisions, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not optimal for optics.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive. The price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65 inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point that is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eye can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it either. If it's true, the LCD TV is also really “direct”. Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Also, if the projection screen wasn't a diffuse reflection, it wouldn't be an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens is ignored, and a lot of light is reflected on the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance with a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
Judging from the conditions set: According to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (2015 Revision)”, those who become insurance brokerage companies must meet three key words: shareholders and sponsors have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, a minimum amount of RMB 50 million can only be established, and the consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission must be obtained.
These three rules are actually very harsh. In summary, they need to be strong. They must be approved by the state authority of the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and shareholders must have a good style of work. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, policyholders don't have to question too much whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the newly listed Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Little Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
Judging from the payment model: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of employee wages, Internet products are generally cost-effective. Moreover, payment methods are flexible, support monthly payments, reduce the pressure on policyholders to pay fees, and at the same time maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the point of view of salesman professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional industry, many Internet product customers can apply for insurance on their own, there will be many misunderstandings. In health notices and careers, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, feel that they are healthy or in line, so it is easy to have many hidden claims, and may be denied compensation risk.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners on the Internet channel, and there are also many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan of insurance coverage for 6 million, buying insurance to send a mobile phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid weight and are light. They won't tell the policyholder that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month will need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers don't know what they bought themselves with a charge of one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million dollars (pie fell out of the world).
The free mobile phone delivery is only sent by the special policy number section such as 6666 or 8888 at the end of the policy, and if the winning text message is sent, you do not redeem it yourself, and no one reminds you.
(This is another pit for policyholders.) Receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance free of charge is short-term. If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance. If you really get seriously ill, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and later life will start streaking.
Currently, the state is also severely cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So if you look at it all together, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject owner carefully consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers to cover offline products, and each saved 2000-3,000 yuan/year on premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor insurance products for customers, shop around for customers, try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers, after applying for insurance, do policy collation for customers, policy hosting, so that customers can rest assured that they are worry-free.
Grow with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answers will be helpful to the title owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking the application link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the application of Internet insurance does not have a very “sense of ritual”, and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract in any way.
This model is a bit like a “telemarketing” assembly line operation, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, which is that follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us for many years to come?
From before until now, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such acts of personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but we want to put an end to this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, what you need to boycott first is this uncivilized style of work.
From the time you started sending Facebook plus friend requests, then posting ridiculous posts, to your attempts to post so-called my home location and father's name on social media, I have taken an attitude of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to unscrupulously discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as my appearance, figure, good nutrition, and whether I grow strawberries in my bed, if I want to insert them, etc., I... forget it.
How do you know that later I received comments from friends about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing content to your Facebook friend account.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't continue to be silent anymore.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what status you are. In our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to make this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not a picture you made or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to get to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would want someone else to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said OK, you wouldn't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics, or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is at ease with the hearts of the people.
I cut off some of my comments for everyone
No one can impersonate you if you post your own stickers
All I can say is that you are a public enemy of civilization

Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam 2022 -01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese Communist Party media Duowei reports: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to information from the Chinese think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform”, on January 9, the satellite discovered the US military aircraft carrier “USS Carl Vinson” (USS Carl Vinson) near the Barabakh Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the “Carl Vinson” to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time the aircraft carrier “Carl Vinson” has been deployed with an F-35C fighter and a CMV-22 “Osprey” carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US military aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the “Carl Vinson”, is the USS Abraham Lincoln (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C carrier-mounted aircraft squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region is the USS Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuga, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser “Lake Champlain” and the missile destroyer “Stockdahl”.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China A rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

(Weibo @南海战略态势感知) In addition, according to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine “USS Nevada” (USS Nevada), carrying 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The US three aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China during a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said that this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as “boomer submarines” (Boomer submarines).
The whereabouts of the 14 “thunder submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the “Thunder Submarine” “the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity”. This system also includes launch silo ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent meta plunge of 26% and the market capitalization evaporated $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”. Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its revenue comes mainly from advertising. Advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., are Meta's traffic channels regardless of their functional positioning.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest “advertising network”. Many apps are external to Meta ads, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information anymore, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their own information. The normal reaction of most people is certainly not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab at it next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that do maritime business.
Meta has an office of about a few hundred people in Hong Kong, and there are also several major agents in mainland China.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta earned quite a bit of money from Byte in the previous two years.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage where Chinese companies burn money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platform, including TT, is out of the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just falling incomes, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly depends on future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations weren't enough.
In order to tell the market a new story Zuckerberg told the “meta universe”.
The meta universe should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the realization cycle of the meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook right now. It also earns 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars a year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it doesn't have a good security moat.
Although several of his social software models are now relatively active and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook doesn't have much confidence, and disruption is a blink of an eye.
And the concept of engaging in the meta-universe, which is promising and out of reach, has no hope of success at all in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is the root reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company again and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice was wrong. It's a path of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
