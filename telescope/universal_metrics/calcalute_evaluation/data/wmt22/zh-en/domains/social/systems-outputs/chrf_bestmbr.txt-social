Let me start with the conclusion, I personally think that "The Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie in every sense.
But if you want to say whether this movie has no bright spot, it's not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that lets you fall asleep soundly in the movie theater is one type, one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching itJames “The Four Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to audiences. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel. It is indescribable, and there are many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after watching it you will wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly talk about some of the things that I have a hard time understanding.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he lives together with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to watch the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father were also very relieved about this.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters of the speeding party on the island easily sealed a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road was stopped by the side of the road, and the truck driver could not even be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a gangster gangster who has poor credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sits outside the room door to sleep for the night?
These kinds of inexplicable plots are present throughout the entire film, and they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the main point of the moviedefined, or that the film doesn't have a main point at all, just a hideous-looking Stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes you might guess that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through examination, you may think that it might be a drama that would reflect the difficult survival of the youth in the small town. After watching the movie, you would measuring in and have no idea what you've watched as a result. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself, why the most New Year's Eve decided to go to the cinema to enjoy their shit.
For most people, they are actually familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then you would be inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie managed to achieve success step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, you can honestly tell about the grievances between the young man in the small town who likes to ride motorcycles and the girl who waited.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot have something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character Yin Zheng played in whose new motorcycle was just burned, and can sing), then he couldn't get to some brain holes that even Kennedy could not stand watching.
As for the heroine, who is obviously not mentally retarded, but she acts like a 5-year-old child in some respects. I really don't know if this is because of her acting skills or what the director requests.
Another thing that I can't understand, as a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Is it because such movies are arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been given away!

I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I won’t be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Is not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal case is more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of "starter shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, and the vibration is too high, the hard ball cannot stand up, and it is difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and know that you are reluctant to buy expensive ones or make a cheap one to fool you. When you play it twice, you won't play anymore. This way, this beat is cheap and you do not feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress, then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are not worth the price. New auctions would be just 500 and 600, and second-hand 200. Wouldn’t it be too pleasant to buy a thousand-yuan racketren?
It is very friendly to beginners, but once you pass the novice stage, it will be tasteless, but most people, especially girls, cannot get past the novice stage.

What's hottest in 2021?
Without a doubt it was the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, there was a very popular article “Look at the Olympic Games which Project Managers Can Strike To Gold Medal] . It mentioned that the project managers definitely can take the lead in many projects为此 and nobody else can match them up: Moving bricks, traveling on business and staying up all night are the daily routines of the project managers, and fighting fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are not a matter of crud.
The article that seems to be a joke, but it also pointed out the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the inability of the current project management work.
And the personnel who are engaged in project management work, are also gradually choosing to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professionals) applicants, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Twenty Years of Development Report on Project Management in China (1999 - 2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China has nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed PMP® certification is about 420,000, and there are about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certificate holder.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year. This shows that more and more project managers丛realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience", and the ever-changing working environment has taught us that we need to learn and explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does taking the PMP exam guarantee the smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really implement project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, making no project management theory and not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, inability to implement at work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and procrastination on projects; unclear division of labor among members, and the dead-sticks in the team don't know how to deal cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, so the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers. It has won the honorary titles such as "Chinese Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and brought the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
Online Course of R&D Project Manager Special Training Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to the enterprises.
Words have no evidence, you can first look at what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei R&D and management team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies.
Furthermore, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms, to help students transform and apply the learning content to specific work after class.
It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of supercars in the Xinshan District!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, and the replacement model of Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits. Four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, I don't know, the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It is probably that when my myvi will only reach 30km/h, others will reach 100km/h, umm Supreme.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching it wherever you go, so I’m very uncomfortable! (Actually, it’s a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (the car owner does not care at all)
You should practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won’t be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The sound of the engine is too loud, and I will deaf immediately after getting out of the car. (But still very cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door is opened!
It's a little lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said it by himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, please contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that all car fans know, the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also millions!
That day, the foreign countries have knocked down one million sports car 911 and ten million supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, the expensive is justified!
When NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their job opportunities due to the epidemic began to gain stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to "Honor of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I read a news about a friend 's stock price, my biggest feeling is that the company chooses the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, we should choose industries with large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more . In the second place, we must choose industries with good future growth, and consider the industries in which the growth rate of the industry will reach the best status in the next 3-5 years. Finally, we must choose an industry that has policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are about "do the things right", which is doing things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, above the rate of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether it should continue to deepen in the current field or extend it in the horizontal field (strategic thinking). For example, in order to enhance customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to investigating how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high value customers (strategic thinking甸 microscopy). In addition to improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct campaign goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate new translation;结局, improving DAU (tactical thinking), considering whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares’ launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, and the exposure to cryptocurrency investments has expanded again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after negotiating with family member Lin of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the factory, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Building Sales Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be designated to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
The house that was finally in his fabulous position, the deposit was paid, and the payment for the house was ready, just before the signing of the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
Following trial, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed on the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied to this case, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability for double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer reminder】 You must exercise the necessary duty of prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you must perform the necessary duty of prudent care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house and whether the house is occupied by others and other relevant information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, to prevent disputes between the parties during contract performance.

I accidentally read the following article which talks about why this customer asks a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspectives of business and shelf life, although the canning is processed by deep processing, not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following article may explain why the customer wants to do it?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and have contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the powdered milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: why is there such a big price difference between the price of cans and bags?
In fact, from this point, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
There are also consumers who reacted after eating them out of this mentality and said that the taste or taste of the cans was simply different!
Now let me tell you first about the reasons why listening outfits are expensive. Where is the price?
Why are they the same raw materials and why the price difference is so big?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them take into consideration that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or that there is no profit, so what can the manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging rather than bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions on advertising expenses or even hundreds of millions of dollars every year, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as salesmen at the shopping malls, display fees in shopping malls, gift fees for products, and advertising expenses, are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and it is also in canned packaging, and their prices are also rising continuously. In fact, they are new products that come out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, pull out any means, link with doctors in hospitals, and they assist with the promotion of the products, with a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a can.
However, relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such a method of operation, in fact, this kind of practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise that you have a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing properties of the milk powder, which has no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf lives of cans and bags after the package are opened, the shelf life of the cans is the same as that of the bags, but the bags are not easy to store after opening, and easily deteriorated by moisture.
I just saw an article about menstruation period, it was too long.
A little science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period someday between the ages of 13-15, and will have amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will come again even more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will roll over in bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
The menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary pad or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period starts, before there is time to have dysmenorrhea, can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but it is useless to take it after the dysmenocorder begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to the cycle, I have diarrhea inexplicably, and basically menstrual period will occur within two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, and you should remove sleeping time. The worst case is to replace it six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add preparations in advance, there may be 50 pieces, instead of one every month.
(Make a modification here, tampons do not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed once every five or six hours, and the longest is eight hours)
During menstruation, the hormonal disturbance may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body. That is, it is very unfortunate, the body makes troubles for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems to make excuses.
It was not just blood that was flowing, it contained the shedding of the lining of the uterus.
After menstruation is over, the endometrium is the thinnest, which gradually thickens after that. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guest does not come, they are completely demolished (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, and the cycle starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day several days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women into crying that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but the times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and that women's body is disgusting for the preparations they make for life, they shouldn't say it in public, girls stand up, stop thinking about it, men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't understand anything very well, don't be so ungrateful and not knowing what the hell will be, how can I be so embarrassed to face my mother and want my child through such an attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it's really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "The metaphysical is called the Dao and the metaphysical is called the utensils" in the Book of Changes·Xūrūga, which was translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) and translated from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existence entities, and which nouns only represent a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
The methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not say anything about God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of the moral life of human beings; here, morality is defined as all the principles of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics(the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics(evaluation of various moral viewpoints and recommendations for ethical guidelines for right or wrong behaviors).
It studies the patterns of moral code of conduct that people should follow), applied ethics (the study of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from the observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices that are made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to their decisions, and investigates the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne and others.
The second part: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative: Hume et al., 17-18th century, Continent rationalism ethics, representative: Spinoza et al. The 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire and other representatives, 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century, British utilitarianism and others: 9th century representatives: Etcological ethics, New era Ethics, New York, Nigel et al., New Germany ethics, New Cook et al. Representation in Hackier Ethics, 19th century representative figures, Cheeker et al, New 19th century ethics, German ethics, Elephets et Arte Geoffen et al., New Etc.
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards for valid inference and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline as the subject of the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thank you to your friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I carried out an appeal for humanitarian assistance in my personal name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Now the old parents of most of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and are employed by their families.
It was your acts of righteousness that helped us through the most difficult times as families in distress.
At the current time, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retirement.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop donating to our bereaved family-Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid activity should have come to a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance services in both the China Federation of American Independent Media (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Federation of Independent States and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

The relief funds are often not delivered to the victims of the June 4th Movement smoothly.
In 1994, following the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans' Relief Fund for Two Orphans in Special Hardship", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects is mainly from campus and social donations during the June 4th Movement, as well as from the generous donations from individuals and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, that the families of victims of the June Fourth finally received a donation from Hong Kong that raised part of the donation in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Master Ding stopped the donations for the 6th 4th June 4th donation because of donor’s consideration. We are indeed some retired old people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement. WeOne and I would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his letter “To friends”.
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families to terminate this program within two years and resume immediately if necessary.
We would like to express our thanks and respect to all the fellow chivalrous colleagues who have consistently given generously and risked their humanitarian aid over the years.
A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do not have this idea, you may better study by yourself. After all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important thing.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution would be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong in the teaching staff.
Secondly, check about this training institution before choosing it, and it’s best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because I have not given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated with a major in computer science, then I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the lowest efficiency and cost method. Many offline and online training institutions are actually good, but the cost of first learning is high, and the second investment恙 is relatively long, and it basically requires 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are now free, or there are many training resources at station b. If you can not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also fine.
In addition, there are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer science major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for your learning, then it is recommended to study at a training institution, so that you will not have to struggle very much. The teachers will explain in great detail, and if you have questions, someone will answer them specifically. Besides, it is also helpful in studying planning or supervision.
And now, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal referrals, and after studying, you will be recommended to go to the company, so that the interview process of looking for a彤 can save a lot of trouble.
The above are some of my opinions, because I don't know your situation, I only give a general introduction and not detailed information. If you have anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamp installations, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thanks to those who silently praised me, work hard for life, life is very tiring but continue
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, please follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me praise
This is what life is like, others only look at the results, they support the process by themselves. Faced with life, we have nothing but to be strong, but to continue, we have no choice. We can look back at the road but cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of intention.
Although we do the dirtiest job in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer’s home with the most serious attitude. Seeing satisfied smiles and thumbs up from customers, all the hard work will be worthwhile at that moment, and the efforts will ultimately pay off!

To be successful can only be achieved if you do it with heart, and with meticulousness to create exquisiteness, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me a chance, you will definitely be satisfied, the quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
The current industries are not good for any business!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persist enough, and work hard enough, then I will be a little better than others, at least it’s better than sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, and all good things start in the early morning. I hope you will start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and good luck. Start a new day and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.

At every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability that restrains you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will eventually be solved.
Second, although there were periods of success for the Rightists in history, it was not that long, so the short is because they would become bright with a little sunshine, sweating with drink a little water; they would have themselves been only successful if they got a little aspirational, and fled when they were attacked.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I dont completely agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about him, and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti- Communist theory, I think that he is against a necessary revolution, and that revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, and various political groups will be established, furthermore, foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who attempt political speculation to reap our chestnuts from the fire are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left, is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right’s words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have this fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently I saw some friends fighting against thieves while refuting leftist cunts, and they are so really angry, I don't think that it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and Zuo epilepsy, because they剂量 all for nothing and they are unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting rebels and lefties to admit it, why bother?
I generally tell my friends this: When the rebel scold you for fifty cents, and when left madman scolds you as a right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they will become paranoid.
And the ideal is getting further and further away, and even the dragon slayer eventually becomes a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom, from the innate genes of history and culture of China, China should be left inclined as a whole.
While the domestic right wing is free and focuses on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Now society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the rivalry between China and the United States has a certain tendency to be left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Huahua is just so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" companies.
The US emperor suppresses the Chinese chip industry, and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in the development of chip manufacturers’ investment and production capacity. Conflow thus led to a disorder of global chip supply chain shortages.
Today the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies, and the increase of the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to go down the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has made frequent蜡烛 moves recently, and is hosting the "chip summit"; it has also invited giants from 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance and made grants to support the domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the old-fashioned technology giant Intel, spent US $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business.
When most people thought that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this conviction is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and possesses a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou's speech was surprising. Regarding Intel's move to invest in the construction of a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel is building a chip foundry, which was quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still holds on to a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had always been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, manufacturing, and packaging and testing were all completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering in the 1980s, the chip industry began to see labor division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there is a company specialized in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing can be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it had obvious high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now also starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic that Intel entered the foundry industry.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of the two dragons in February, the price increase of Orion, the event of pulling goods, and the expansion of public opinion formed a crest, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If the secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak shape], [Jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Empty peak shape] means artificially heating, and it quickly rushes into the hot search list to attract public attention; [jag shape] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic entrenches the hot search list; [cliff shape] means collective withdrawal, and the hot search has completed its "function", and he receives a new task and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is equal to every minute. It must have been that a unified batch of navyFields have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which is in charge of popularizing, which diverts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion and which coerces decision-making, and black accounts are inocks in batches and nodes and fine-tuned operations, taking almost all factors in the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science, and regardless of the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, there will be nowhere to hide from the black public relations.
Everyone who walks there will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products born for large-screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The ophthalmology experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions for the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is gaining more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the prices of laser TVs currently available on the market are more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually climbed.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technological level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is not large, and the host is small and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It’s not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing it, you can judge for yourself because you are afraid to hear one side’s word.
Simply put, the ultra wide-angle near-focus projector - the laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is very expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65-inch LCD.
One more point, I especially hate that the projection manufacturers make the diffusion reflection good to the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. You can’t see the diffuse reflection onto the ceiling and the eyes can’t see it. If you want to take a more realistic screen LCD TV is also diffusely “direct”, and when you turn on the TV, the ceiling will be illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be an image at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the脊椎动物 of setting conditions: According to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)”, three key words must be met to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders and promoters must have no major violations records in the last three years, and the minimum amount of RMB50 million can only be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very frustrating. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength, and must be approved by the national authority of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and Banks throughout the country), and shareholders must have a good style of conduct. As the small umbrella insurance of an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all There are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it is not bad and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critic Illness Insurance. Both the claimant and the underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance, and the small umbrella insurance is a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment model of view: products of the Internet platform, because there is less operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salaries of salesmen, Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment methods are flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of insurance policyholders, and can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the professionalism point of view of clerks: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can apply for insurance themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or fit, so that there are many hidden dangers in claims and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done an insurance telephone sale with “Tencent Micro Insurance” (which, like Little Umbrella, is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you this.
The Internet insurance is real and reliable, and it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, 1 yuan for insurance cover of 6 million yuan, buying insurance for mobile phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid the important ones and will not tell the policyholder. One yuan for the first month and the next month should be charged normally, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought by themselves.
I thought that I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell like a pie).
Free mobile phone is only sent to the special policy number section of the insurance policy ending number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be redeemed by itself, and no one will remind it.
(This is another pit for the insurance policyholder) The free coverage of 60,000 critical illness insurance is short-term. If you rely on this, and you have no other commercial insurance, if a serious illness occurs, what can you do with 60,000 because it cannot solve the problem? Life will start streaking in the future.
At present, the country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So in general, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the subject should comprehensively consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers by myself, underwriting offline products, and saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in insurance premiums for each person.
If you have any questions, please feel welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker who has 3 years experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly one thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing an insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance placement, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will organize insurance policies for customers and manage褶 them so that customers can feel at ease.
Together with each client, grow up with every customer for life.
Hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which an insurance applicant can independently complete all the insurance application process after clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insurance applicant independently.
Although Internet insurance investment does not have a “ceremonial sense”, and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telephone sales" but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is – the follow-up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and will provide us with services after many years?
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accepting such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at the political parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, followed by ridiculous posts, and the last moment to your attempt to post my home location and father’s name on social media, I’ve taken a non-response attitude.
Then you intensified, and you have not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but also without restraint, on Facebook, and with your so-called friends, you continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, body shape, good fertility, how to grow strawberries in the bed, and whether you should insert them, so let me…forget it.
How could I know that later I received a lot of friends' messages from a number of friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friends account and making comments that were sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of playful, obscure, humiliating, abusive statement, you can continue saying you just love and follow me, you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even keep denying it wasn't your drawing and keep making all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, and have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is any girl who would want to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you okay?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can still say she is okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the human heart.
I cut off some of the message for your comments
There should be no one can impersonate you that your own post.
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization

The Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Multi-dimensional reports by pro-CCP media: the latest news on Sino-US relations:The latest satellite imagery shows that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US轴承 media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellites discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In the US aircraft carriers currently cruising the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the "Carl Vinson", there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3. (USS Abraham Lincoln).
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above-mentioned two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, and the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdale.

(Weibo@南海Strategic Situational Awareness) According to another CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers have assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam, analysis said, which is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.

(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually kept closely guarded.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," which also includes siloed ballistic missiles in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent Meta plunge of 26%, and the market value evaporated by US$251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that “facing unprecedented competition" What the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertisements, and realize the realization of monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain the user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertisement delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about several hundred people in the Hong Kong office, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't been looking into it specifically recently, but it definitely won't be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn't just the declining revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets not only look at income, but more importantly, what the future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Absent from the fact that Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software currently have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the subversion is only The blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is absolutely no hope of success within a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks. The root reason, but I think his choice of tracks is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts, for reference.
