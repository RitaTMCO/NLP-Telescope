First of all, the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie is not a highlight or not, it is not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad films, so that you can sleep soundly in the cinema is counted as one, so that you can be indignant after watching it is also a kind of one, "Four Seas" to the audience is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Croat novel, inexplicable, and full of loopholes like a trench coat on the little mago.
Even after watching it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of.
Let's start with some of the plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he and his grandmother are dependent on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people riding a van to watch the snow from the south to the northeast??
He and his dad were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and his brother get a business license?
Why can the island biker party gangsters easily seal a section of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
Why would a small flying car party that is not good at credit and suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharking, why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot pervades the film, and because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main theme of the movie, or the theme of the movie at all, is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after more than 20 minutes you guess it may be an inspirational film, half of the time you think it may be a drama film that wants to reflect the difficult survival of small-town youth, after watching it, you don't know what you are watching, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why do you want to run to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you honestly talk about the feud between the small town youth who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot can't come up with something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng has just been burned, and then can still sing), can not go to some of the kennedy can not be bothered to see the brain hole.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally retarded, she can act like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know if this is the reason for the acting or the director's requirements.
Another point I can't understand, why is Han Han so keen to add a crash plot to his own movies as a racing driver?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival stall to add to the blockage of the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then the normal situation of expensive will be friendly than cheap beats, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot stand up, and the master is difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that ——— tennis is so difficult, I know that you can't learn it, and I know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so that this beat is cheap, and you are not distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have improved, and when the time comes to come to me to buy expensive ones, I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can not sell the price, the new 500, 600 is very good, the second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan beat of the enjoyment is not fragrant?
It is very friendly to novices, but once it passes the novice stage, it is chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.

What's hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The project manager can impact the gold medal olympic project" article is very hot, which mentions that the project managers in many projects, absolutely can take the lead, no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire fighting, back pot, apology is not a word.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, and behind it represents the inability to do the current project management work.
The personnel engaged in project management work have gradually chosen to get themselves out of the predicament at work through some actions.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrollments that climb every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Report on the Twenty-Year Development of China Project Management (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of effective holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP licensees has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing working environment lets us know that there is a way to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the relevant knowledge points such as the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups, but when the project management work is really carried out, it is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not be landed, project estimates are not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed again and again; The division of labor among the members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, with the "R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.

Known as the New Mountain Super Run exhaust sound is the loudest!
This time our team brought you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement of the Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
That even if you don't know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably xiaobian's myvi to 30km/h when people will reach 100km/h, well.
The low bodywork, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes that surround the body and the 6.5 v12 engine with unobstructed view under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
For the car description does not need to say too much, their own Google is good, Xiaobian sorted out some Google does not necessarily give to the explanation!
Too much attention, everywhere everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
1km oil money around RM1 (owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still cool)
The body is too large, the parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked on when the car next door opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of Supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!
For more information about cars you didn't know about, it's in The Car Guide
A car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that car owners know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the porsche 911 is also priced in millions!
Before that day, foreign countries knocked out a million sports cars in just a few minutes 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron!
Look at the results, you are reasonable!
At the time when the NFT was rapidly out of the circle, a new concept emerged from the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic have begun to earn a steady income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of gameplay including NFTs, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project, with more than $3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to "Glory of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will pass on a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to the fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first of all, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; Secondly, it is necessary to choose industries with good future growth and consider industries in which the industry growth reaches the best state in the next 3-5 years; Finally, it is necessary to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to get things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen or extend horizontally in the current field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new; On top of the dau (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, el Salvador, a small Central American country, made bitcoin legal tender, the first time bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market, expanding its exposure to cryptocurrency investments again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory building in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, After consulting with lin mou, the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as a payee on the "Deposit Receipt for The Sale and Purchase of Factory Buildings", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agree to sign the plant sale and purchase contract within one week." ”
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory building and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is not easy to see the house, the deposit is paid, the house payment is also ready, it is almost "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, but the seller does not sell, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not be attributed solely to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed that the consultation could not be completed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer reminds】 In the process of transaction, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary duty of care.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by others, etc., and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.

You came to the company with him in a daze, and he said that he saw you on the street at a glance and very much hoped that you would come to participate.

Inadvertently saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help do canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder and the milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will surely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the listening package is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so large?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the listening package is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive to listen to, where is it expensive?
Why is the difference between their raw materials so large?
Because most manufacturers in the pricing of most of the time to consider that if the bagging pricing is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, then what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of the listening package to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly recommend listening to packaging, not bagging.
And you think so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising costs every year, where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotion staff of the mall, the display cost of the mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and it is listening to the clothing, and its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulous, linked to the doctors of the hospital, they assist in the promotion of products, from a listen to the inside of the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such a way of operation, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder into the can under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as the bag after the bag is opened, it is only that the bag is not easy to preserve after the bag is opened, and it is easy to deteriorate by moisture.
Just saw an article about menstrual leave, it's too long.
Give the male science that does not know about it.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual leave one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will also turn over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people have three days, some people have one week; Some people bleed less, some people have a big blood collapse; Some people have no reaction, some people are in pain to the ambulance to transport away, dysmenorrhea will change with time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and all that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, the physiological period has not had time to eat ibuprofen when there is no time for dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to diarrhea.
If you probably reach the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, basically within two days will come to menstruation.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, in addition to sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 tablets, if you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, that is, very unlucky, the body to make a trip.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that's flowing, it contains the shedding endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickened, it can be understood that the uterus is the house, every month to build a house (the lining thickens) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, the cycle begins.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, 24 hours a day a month bleeding, but also abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time you come to this world to live in a house for 10 months, everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that was it, but the times changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation behavior made by the female body for the conception of life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think so, never experienced, will not experience in this life, do not know much about men, do not be so ungrateful and do not know good, how can this attitude be good to face their mothers, how to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which really work.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is a fundamental law of philosophy designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
Chinese translation of the name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "Metaphysical Is the Way of the Metaphysical, Metaphysical Islamic" in the I Ching Andyo Dictionary, which was translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) from metaphysic.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to the method of study that does not say a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between mind and body."
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct endorsed by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theories or criticisms) and normative ethics (judging various moral concepts and giving suggestions on moral codes for right or wrong behavior).
It studies the style of moral code of conduct that people should follow), applied ethics (the study of applying ethical theories to actual life conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the theory of expectations, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.)
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by the likes of Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: The Ethical Thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: The Ethics of Politics, Represented by Machiavelli et al., Modern Ethics (17th-18th centuries, British Empiricist Ethics, Representative Figures: Hume et al., 17th-18th Century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, Representative Figures: Spinoza et al., 18th Century, French Enlightenment Ethics, Representative Figures: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th Century, German Academic Ethics, Representative Figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th-19th Century, British Utilitarian Ethics, Representative figures: Bentham and Sikirvik, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is the study of "principles and criteria for effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline based on the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed to my friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994.
Today, the vast majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to work as families.
It is your act of righteousness that has helped us, the families in distress, through the most difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our refugees, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the All-American Self-Government Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the ALLA and the Minnesota Foundation for Democracy in China are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often intersect.

Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the June Fourth refugees smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June Fourth Orphans and Elderly Special Hardship Household Relief Fund", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June Fourth, from generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the Families of the June Fourth Disaster finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Chinese Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's suspension of June Fourth donations is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement, and we hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
We would also like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and generous for many years and have risked the delivery of humanitarian relief funds.
A programming idiot who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is best to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose to teach yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we must look at the teaching staff of this institution, if the teaching force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to inquire about this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is, and the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, the profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or the computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two more time to invest, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is these situations I said, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to the b station also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, there are also people who have special answers to questions, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal push quotas, and recommend going to the company after learning, so that the interview link to find a job can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, as mentioned earlier because I do not understand your situation, so only a general introduction is not detailed, if you have other ideas to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I, to undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanging furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, professional sewing, housekeeping services
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up, working hard for life Life is tiring but to continue
Life will not live up to everyone who works hard, like to pay attention to me, thank those who silently give me praise
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own support process, in the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, is to continue, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleaning is a job, but also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of intentions.
Cleaning we do the dirtiest work, but we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, at that moment all the tiredness is worth it, pay the final reward!
My daily routine
- Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep the good.
The details you care about, Fenggui Home Economics help you to do "net" what I can, serve the love of home.
Keep all the homes clean, tree home economics monument, service in place, clean to the home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily routine
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull and dull if it is not cleaned for a long time, and only after cleaning can it overflow with brilliance, and life is the same
Do it with heart to succeed, use meticulousness to shape refinement, beauty sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, will definitely make you satisfied, the quality says everything, because the professional is worthy of being trusted, your recognition is what I encourage the most!
At present, all walks of life are not easy to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent enough, and hard enough, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining."
The plan of the day lies in the morning, and all the goodness begins in the early morning I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishes, and keep a good mood all day, good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and happiness was happiness when I had it; When you grow up, happiness is a goal, and when you reach it, you will be happy; After maturity, it is found that happiness is originally a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.
Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; Two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful and bright to live to old age!
At each stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, it is not your ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Second, although the rightists have a prosperous era in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink some boiling water; If you have a little ambition, you will be able to look at Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached to Mao.
But realistically speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution in defining the standard of truth, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statement and respect Li Weidong as a person; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that the anti-essential revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the damage to the people's livelihood, the political group is mixed with mud and sand, and then foreign countries are taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must have a patient and responsible attitude for the country and the people, and those who try to take advantage of the fire in political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Zuo, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right's remarks and analyze their ideas when needed, then the Left will not be created, because what the Left wants is the dross that the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, recently I have seen some friends refuting their left epilepsy while intimidating thieves, and they are still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with the traitors and zuo yi, they are all a tendon and have no reason to talk about.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making the anti-thief and the left epileptic admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, when the left scolds your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue ideals, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon slayer teenager eventually became a dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to constraint and freedom, China from the innate genes of history and culture lead to China as a whole should be on the left.
The domestic right is free and pays attention to efficiency and development, and the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left side is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'm done with liking
Don't say anything, huahua is such a righteous thing
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei's chips by the US imperialists has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" enterprises.
The US imperialist suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, resulting in a shortage of chip supply chain disorder around the world.
Nowadays, "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more national technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the control of global semiconductors and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, Lao Mei has recently made frequent moves and hosted the "Chip Summit"; For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the veteran technology giant of the United States, spent $20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to steal TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as an established technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, and Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's move to build a fab factory: Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite dismissive of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still grumpy about a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US imperialist manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world and being the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, manufactured to be packaged and tested by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by huge production line construction costs.
Under the inspiration of market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a special design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a small minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once looked for Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did manufacturing in the chip industry, it was obvious that some of them had high self-esteem, looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services now have to start doing wafer foundries.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm of 7 years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February two dragons to raise heads, Good Liyou price increase, goods Lala incident, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if the secondary public opinion will have a small hump appear again.
They look exactly like the "Model of Internet Public Opinion Evolution" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "lone peak-like", "jagged", and "cliff-like".
[Lone peak shape] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search, causing public concern; [Jagged] that is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list; [Cliff-like] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search to play a "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad every second, and it must be a unified batch of water troops who receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which coercive decisions, black industry accounts in batches, nodes and fine operations, almost taking into account all the elements of public opinion dissemination and spread.
Communication is a science, putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks by will leave a trace, and such a trace, we will dig it out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are products of large-screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of global shipments and sales of laser TVs has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why there are such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eyeball, compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also smaller.
Experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronics Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small, occupying a small place.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Talk about pseudo demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment, they are afraid to listen to one side of the word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which did not meet the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel curtains, expensive, 80-inch price can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LIQUID crystal.
There is also a point, I especially hate the projection manufacturer to take diffuse reflection to the eyes as a selling point, please, the eyes can see the light on the curtain is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be more real LCD TV is also a diffuse "direct shot", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not become like it at all.
It is precisely because the heat spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance with a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very harsh, summed up is to have strength, to be approved by the national authority department of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervision of insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders must have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured does not have to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies of star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest list of Hetai Super Mary No. 5 serious illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: The products of the Internet platform, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: This is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this piece, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feel that they are healthy or compliant, so it is easy to have a lot of hidden claims, there may be the risk of being denied.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Xiao Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true and reliable, unreliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are also a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is needed to be charged according to normal, dozens to 200 range, many customers deduct a year or two to buy what is not clear.
Thinking that you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company pays 6 million (the world drops the pie).
Free mobile phone delivery, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 this special policy number section is sent, and if the winning SMS is sent, they do not redeem, no one reminds.
(For the insured, it is another pit) free 60,000 serious illness insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of real serious illness, 60,000 can not solve the problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, the platform is no problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is better than that of Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and saving 2,000-3,000 yuan per person in premiums per year.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, has 3 years of business management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying, I will start from customer needs, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers to shop around, try their best to fight for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy collation, policy custody, so that customers rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
Hope my answer is helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ritualistic", and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
From before to now, I have opposed any form of slander and insult, let alone accepted such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, then making ridiculous posts, to your attempts to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive approach.
After that, you intensified not only according to the frequency of six meals a day to continue to tag me, but also on Facebook with your so-called friends continue to brazenly discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, good health, and what kind of strawberries grow in bed, whether to insert or not to insert messages, I... That's it.
Later, I received a number of friends about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent anymore.
After the news of my report to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, we need to be respected by both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you are just caring and caring about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there's a girl who would want someone to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said yes, and you won't believe it either.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say she's okay after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not have even basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some of the messages for everyone to comment
You should post yourself that no one can impersonate you
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization
Will smile
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-CHINA media Multidimensional report: The latest news from Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is strategically located on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carriers that are now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the CARL Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried for the first time the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, is also based on the USS Ronald Reagan in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdale".

(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
Analysis said this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China's Most Powerful Weapons Rare Visit to Guam In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture shows Fiery Cross Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, state of readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles based on the U.S. mainland, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, which wiped out $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that "facing unprecedented competition" for what reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the income mainly comes from advertising, today's money-making advertising companies, they have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional targeting, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, through Meta's advertising platform is to achieve monetization.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will be obvious whether users will allow the app to obtain their own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Companies that make sea businesses in China.
Meta has an office of about a few hundred people in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from Byte.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of massive burning of money overseas by Chinese companies is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in revenue, but more importantly, how the future is expected.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story for the market, Zuckerberg told the "metacosm".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metacosm has a relatively long realization cycle, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook is very beautiful now, there are 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars in revenue every year, in fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high in daily life, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and the subversion is also a blink of an eye.
And engaging in the meta-universe of this unattainable concept, in a short period of time there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a road of no return The above is some of my thoughts, for reference.
