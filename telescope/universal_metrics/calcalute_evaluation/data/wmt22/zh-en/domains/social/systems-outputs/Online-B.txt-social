Let me start with the conclusion. I personally think that "The Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie has no bright spot, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that makes you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and one that makes you feel indignant after watching it. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can be used for countless a way to ignite your anger.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel.
Even after watching it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly talk about some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south and depend on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van? ?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the hostess and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters of the speeding party on the island easily seal a section of the mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a gangster who has no credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the door to sleep for the night?
This inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and the plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the movie's theme, or the movie has no theme at all, just a hideous stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you thought it might be a drama that wanted to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in the small town. I don't know what I watched, and what followed was a deep doubt about myself, why would I go to the cinema to enjoy the poop when I was a New Year's Eve.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then inspiration + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you can honestly tell the grievances and grievances between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show things that are contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role in which his new motorcycle was burnt and then he could sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand watching.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally handicapped but in some ways acts like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is because of her acting skills or the director's request.
There's one more thing I don't understand. As a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal case will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't stand it, and it is difficult for the expert to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is—Tennis is so difficult, I know you can’t learn it, and I know you are reluctant to buy expensive ones, and make a cheap one to fool you. If you play twice, you won’t play again. This way This beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. Then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, choose prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets can't sell for the price, new auctions 500, 600 are very good, second-hand 200 yuan, isn't the enjoyment of having a thousand yuan shot not fragrant?
It's very friendly to novices, but once it's past the novice stage, it's tasteless, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Projects That Project Managers Can Hit Gold Medal" is very popular. It mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. , apology is not a problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Ten Years of Project Management Development Report in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certification holders was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders About 300,000 people, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" in the past. On the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does the PMP test ensure that the project management work is smooth and unobstructed?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Insufficient knowledge of project management, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, but not knowing how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to implement at work, inaccurate project estimates, The control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; the division of labor among members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the poor communication between departments, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles. Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting came with the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method. It combines practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers. Take the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
You can take a look at what other students say about this course: This course is not only developed by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei R&D management team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies , to provide a professional explanation of the course content in simple language.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students transform and apply what they have learned to specific work after class.
It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District is the loudest!
The car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits. Four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don’t know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably when my myvi reaches 30km/h, others will reach 100km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all over the body and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too high-profile, everyone is watching it wherever I go, I'm very uncomfortable! (actually kinda cool)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the car cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that you will be instantly deaf when you get out of the car. (but still cool)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in an ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!
A bit lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information you don't know, it's in The Car Guide / People's Auto Record

Look at the results, expensive is justified!
When NFT was out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology. It integrates a variety of gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game , and can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the company on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; secondly, To choose an industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are "do the things right," which is to do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or extend it horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on improving the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core customers and high value. Customer retention rate (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate Pull new; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency of a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Deposit Receipt for Plant Sale and Purchase" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit will go to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. It is agreed to sign the plant sales contract within a week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the method of payment, which led to the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Finally, the deposit was paid and the house payment was ready, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end, which cannot be attributed to the defendant alone. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Attorney Reminder】 In the process of trading, you must exercise the necessary prudence and care.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary prudence and care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent the performance of the contract. disputes arise between the two parties.

Accidentally read the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why this customer asked a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of bonded logistics companies, here is the following This text might explain why the client wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
There are also consumers who reacted after eating with this mentality and said that the taste or taste of the cans is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why the listening device is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why do they have the same raw materials and the price difference is so big?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, for example: the promotion staff of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are canned, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked with the doctors in the hospital, and they will assist in the promotion of the products, and they will take a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such a method of operation. In fact, this practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans is the same as that of bags after opening, it's just that the bags are not easy to store after opening, and are prone to moisture deterioration.
I just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
For men who don't know about it.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13-15 and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
Afterwards, on the premise of good health, it will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be able to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance.
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; Change, no pain in the past does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
The menstrual period is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck the blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period begins before there is time for dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take it after the dysmenorrhea begins.
Due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to the cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically menstruation will come within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the pre-prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, tampons don’t need to be changed often, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal disturbance during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It wasn't just blood that was flowing, it contained the shed lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, they are all removed (menstrual discharge). Months to build a new house, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, bleeding 24 hours a day, a few days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But people can be born because their mothers have menstrual periods. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mothers for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation of the female body for life is disgusting, it should not be said in public, girls stand up, stop thinking this way, never experienced it, and will not in this life Men who have experienced and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and don’t know what to do. How can you be so embarrassed to face your mother and want your own children with this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it's really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the Tao, and the metaphysical is called the instrument" in "Book of Changes • Xie Shang", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that does not say a word about God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judgment of various moral views, and give moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of moral code people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live their lives) , summarizing from the observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral some ethics).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially since I issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my personal name in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far. Rescue.
Now, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started working as families.
It was your act of righteousness that helped us as families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have also retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to our bereaved family, the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid activity should have come to an end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Federation of Independent States and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphaned Elderly Specially Poor Household Relief Fund", which has been implemented until now. .
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations during the June 4th Movement, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the family members of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of the June 4th Movement that year.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently carried out their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4th donation for the sake of the donors. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our thanks to Mr. Ding for his letter "To a friend".
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families to terminate the program within two years and resume immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have been generous and risky to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.
A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don’t have this idea, it’s better to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the faculty of this institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will all be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from a computer science major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good. , but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more, and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources at station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact through the profile. Come to me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the study will not be very strenuous, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be someone to answer any questions. In addition, in the study planning Or supervision can also help.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, and there are internal referral quotas. After learning, you can recommend to the company, so that you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process of looking for a job later.
The above are some of my opinions. Because I don’t know your situation, I only give a general introduction and are not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently praised me, working hard for life is very tiring but keep going
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, follow me if you like, thank those who silently praise me
This is how life is. Others only look at the results and support the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back on the road but we cannot go back...
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of attentiveness.
Although we do the most dirty work in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the tiredness at that moment is gone. It's worth it, the hard work pays off!
my day job
——Your request, my service.
Serve attentively, clean attentively, and keep the beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping has helped you to "clean" what I can and serve the loving family.
Keep thousands of homes clean, set up housekeeping monuments, service in place, and clean home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine. Life is also like this.
To do it with heart can be successful, to create exquisiteness with meticulousness, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me a chance, and you will be satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is trustworthy, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
All walks of life are not good at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent, and work hard, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
The plan of the day is in the morning, all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good luck, and keep a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and it was happiness to have it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and it was happiness when it was achieved; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and it was happiness when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one way in life, and you have to walk your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and living beautifully until old age!
At every stage of life, there are different challenges.
In many cases, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will be solved.
2. Although the rightists have had a successful era in history, they have not been long, so they are short because a little sunshine will make them bright, and a little boiled water will make you sweat; if you have a little success, you will be able to look forward to Shu, and if you are attacked, you will be attached to the generals.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about what he said and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems. seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries to take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we must have a patient and responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who try to take chestnuts from the fire by political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right's speech and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have such a good fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who were arguing against the thieves and refuted the left epilepsy, and they were really angry. I don't think it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the left epilepsy, they are all one-strand, unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the thieves and the left madmen admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you fifty cents, and when the left man calls you the right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal is getting farther and farther, and even the dragon slayer eventually becomes a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes of history and culture have led to the fact that China as a whole should be left-biased.
While the domestic right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, in the dispute between China and the United States, it is certain that it will turn to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so loyal
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies from allied countries to block my country's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , resulting in the chaos of the global chip supply chain shortage.
Today, the "lack of chips" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in countries have begun to "de-beautify".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old and the United States have recently made frequent moves, hosting the "chip summit", and inviting giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and funding to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, spent US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. Regarding Intel's move to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US imperialist manufacturing industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were all completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to divide labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design. in wafer fabrication plants.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously a bit self-righteous and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past have now started to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Orion, the event of goods pulling, the spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again. .
They look the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [Lone Peak Shape], [Jagged Shape], and [Cliff Shape].
[Lone Peak Shape] means artificial heating, quickly rushing to the hot search list, attracting public attention; [Sawtooth shape] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [Cliff shape] means collective withdrawal, and the hot search is finished function", received new tasks and rushed to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that a unified batch of naval forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones lead the battle, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, and which ones coerce decision-making , Black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products for large-screen TVs.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the ophthalmologist of Peking Union Medical College Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that: laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when more and more attention is paid to vision health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous drop in the price of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs on the market are mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
Definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing You can judge for yourself, but you are afraid to listen to one side's words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structured Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes can’t see it. So, if you have to be more realistic, LCD TVs are also diffusely "direct". Isn't the ceiling of the TV also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot be imaged at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is just ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, promoters, no major illegal records in the past 3 years, minimum limit It can be established only for RMB 50 million and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very harsh. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength. It must be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good style. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance , the insured does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, not bad, is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance, Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, and there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of sales staff’s wages, and the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payment, and reducing the payment pressure of policyholders. , and at the same time, the lever of the insurance can be leveraged to the maximum extent.
This is still very good.
Can consider it.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the salesperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, Non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or fit, which is prone to many hidden dangers in claim settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telesales on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insured 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important ones. The fee ranges from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct the fee for a year or two and they are not sure what they bought.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent to the special policy number segment of the policy tail number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be redeemed by itself, and no one will remind it.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The free coverage of 60,000 critical illness insurance is short-term. If you only rely on this, there are no other commercial insurances. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? No problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and each person has saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in insurance premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in corporate management training, has served nearly 1,000 corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance process, we shop around for our customers and try our best to get the best underwriting results for our customers. After we apply for insurance, we will arrange the policies for the customers and take care of the policies, so that the customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the online insurance does not have a "ceremonial sense", it may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line of "telephone sales", but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an agent that can accompany us for a long time and in many years' time? What about the "insurance intermediaries" who also serve us?
From the past to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests and then making sarcastic posts to the time you tried to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends. Leave a message about growing strawberries on the bed, whether to insert it or not, I... forget it.
How could I know that later I received a number of friends from friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend account and remarks that were sexually harassing.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't be silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to say that this is sarcastic, obscure, humiliating, abusive, you can continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your fault or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would want to be so humiliated in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut off part of the message for your review
No one can impersonate you in your own posts.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
smile knowingly
Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, satellites discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the U.S. aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean include the "USS Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above-mentioned two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam, analysts said, sending a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on a rare visit. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and Continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually closely guarded.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," a system that also includes siloed ballistic missiles located in the continental United States, as well as nuclear-capable warheads such as the B-2 and B-52 bomber.
Chatting with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, and the market value has evaporated by 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that "faced with unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps have external Meta advertisements, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about several hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the first two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it specifically lately, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, it's the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current popularity. It also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software now have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is the blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is absolutely no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for it. The root cause of the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
