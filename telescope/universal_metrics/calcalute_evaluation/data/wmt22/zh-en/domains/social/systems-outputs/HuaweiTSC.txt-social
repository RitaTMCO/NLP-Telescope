First of all, I personally think that The Four Seas is an all-round bad movie, in all senses.
But if you say that the film is not a bright spot, it is not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, which can make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and which can make you feel indignant after watching it. The Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really a talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a genre novel, indescribable, and full of loopholes like a windbreaker on little Margo.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First, briefly say some of the plots that I have difficulty understanding.
The man's main place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minibus.
The elderly people are sitting in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
How did the hostess get the business license when she opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small bastard of the island car party easily seal off a mountain road??
Then the truck delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small bastard who can't get credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why did the police not report to the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arrange to not find the hotel owner, sit outside the room and sleep for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot pervades the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, what is even worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, just a hideous stitch up monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, and after more than 20 minutes, you guessed it might be an inspirational film, and when you saw it, you thought it might be a drama film that wanted to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you would not know what you saw, and then you would have a deep doubt about yourself.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the feud between the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waiter sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not appear something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role in a new motorcycle that has just been burned and can still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand to see.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for the acting or the director's request.
I also wonder why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival stalls, is it to add to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!!

I want to try tennis, but I am afraid I can't hold on to it, so I want to find a practitioner at a similar price first.
In fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot withstand, and the master is very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and I know you don't want to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, and if you play it twice, you won't play it again, so the beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress, and then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better used racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket will not sell at a price, new rackets 500, 600 is very good, used 200 yuan, the enjoyment of a thousand yuan racket is not fragrant?
It is very friendly to the novice, but after the novice stage, it is very difficult, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest year in 2021?!
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! Project Managers Can Impact Gold in Olympic Projects" which was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and fighting fires, taking the pot, and apologizing is not a problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the incompetence of the current project management work.
The people who are engaged in project management work also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 PMP ® applicants nationwide, about 420,000 people passed PMP ® certification, and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but when they really work on project management, they are still confused.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Project management knowledge is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and they do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to implement the project in the work, project estimates are not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again; the division of labor is not clear, the "old" in the team does not know how to deal with the poor communication between departments, and the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles.
The online course "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" is an online fragmented learning method that combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
This course is not only conducted by a team of experts from Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to provide an in-depth and professional explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform their learning content into concrete work after class.
It is said that the exhaust sound of super-running in the new mountain area is the loudest!!
This time our team brought you this car, which is the dream of many men!!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - the Aventador LP700-4!!
The price is nearly two million ringgit, the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, and it is probably the myvi of Xiaobian that will reach 30km/h when people will reach 100km/h, huh.
The low body, the arrogant scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass are the perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and Xiao Bian has put together some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
The 1km fuel money is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all).
The position of getting on and off the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will not climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half).
The engine is too loud, and when you get off the car, you will be deaf. (But it is still very cool)
The car is too big, it will be very narrow to park in a normal parking space, and I am afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiao Bian himself said, has nothing to do with the owner, haha).
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!!
For more information about cars you don't know, go to The Car Guide/People's Car Journal.
Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that all riders know that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!!
Look at the results, expensive is reasonable!!
As the NFT rushed out of the loop, a new concept emerged in the cryptographic community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which combines various gameplay methods including NFT, and is the highest NFT project in terms of transaction volume, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily live users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, and with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, and can participate in the management of the game ecology in addition to the fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the track, which refers to the choice of the target industry for investment. First, we should choose the industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan. Second, we should choose the industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing."
Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to land, in most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen the current field or extend the horizontal field (strategic thinking); on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling news; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a housing agency. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, the family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory building, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Sale and Purchase Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the method of payment, which led to the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
When the deposit was paid and the house was ready, the seller signed the contract on the spot, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed to be a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract for double return of the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer reminds] In the course of the transaction, we should exercise the necessary due diligence.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and to specify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian. This is the second week you moved to Japan.
When you walk down the street and suddenly find someone following you, you walk faster and faster in fear, and finally you run.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese conversation) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss... I am a director. I see you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very confused and afraid that this is a scam.
He slipped you a business card, and you found out that he was really the director of a major Japanese entertainment company.
"If Miss has time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay must be necessary."
You were confused and came to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street and hoped you would come to the company.
You signed the contract thinking that there was no loss and you could make money.
This is a big love reality show, divided into two parts.

Inadvertently, I saw the following article, from the point of view of business and shelf life, why the customer wanted the logistics company in the bonded area to help do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, there is no difference.
Then everyone will ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality after eating reaction also said that the taste or taste of the cans is not the same!!
Now let me tell you first about the reason why the cans are expensive. Where is the expensive?
Why is the price difference so big that they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or no profits, so what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of the cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
So with the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as the sales staff of shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of product gifts, and the cost of advertising, are also increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is also constantly adding new products, and the price of the cans is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, use any means to link up with doctors in hospitals, who will assist in the promotion of their products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a single listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder in bags and put it in cans on the premise that you have cans at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans is the same as that of bags after opening, it is just that the bags are not easy to store after opening and are susceptible to moisture deterioration.
I just saw an article about the official holiday. It's too long.
Give men who don't know science popularization.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first regular holiday on a certain day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, it will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be able to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will turn over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have less blood flow, some people have a major blood avalanche; some people have no reaction, some people have pain to be transported away by ambulance, and dysmenorrhea will change over time.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding is 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary napkins or tampons to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly before the beginning of the physiological period can effectively relieve the pain in the month. It is useless to eat after the beginning of dysmenorrhea.
Due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release before the physiological period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically two days will come menstruation.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace them 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify it here, the tampons don't have to be changed often, they can be changed every five or six hours, and the maximum is eight hours).
The hormones during menstruation may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will make itself a stumbling block.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It is not just blood that flows, it contains the detached endometrial.
After menstruation, the endometrial membrane is the thinnest, and then thickens slowly. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the endometrial thickens) to welcome guests, but the guests do not come, and all of it is removed (menstrual discharge).
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time when you come to this world to live in a house for 10 months, everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation of the female body for life is disgusting, and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking about it, never experienced it, never experienced it in this life, and men who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful, how can this attitude be so nice to face their mother, how can it be so nice to want their children?
Finally, sisters try the tampon, it really works.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "metaphysical, metaphysical, and metaphysical," which was translated by metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era), a Japanese.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of studying God without saying a word.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (the evaluation of different moral views, and the recommendation of moral principles for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should follow, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the collection of information about how people live, summarizing from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contributed to the decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I issued a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their families.
It was your kindness that helped us, the families in distress, through the most difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is now raging around the world, and most donors have retired every year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is a difficult group for us. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way. Please understand!!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32 years of humanitarian relief work by the All-American Federation of Self-Education (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-American Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the Tiananmen Square.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group was set up by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans Relief Fund for the Elderly in Distress," which has been implemented since.
The funding for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and was supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Reform through Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation is for the sake of the donors, and we are indeed all retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends."
We will respect the decision of the victims to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have been giving generously over the years and risking the delivery of humanitarian aid.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to conduct training, but if you don't have the idea, it is better to study by yourself. After all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
The first thing to look at is the number of teachers in this institution. If the number of teachers is not strong enough, this training institution is of no significance. Of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, it is best to inquire about the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more, and the basic need is 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if this is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources on the b station. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for your study, then it is recommended to study at a training institution, so that you don't have to work very hard, the teacher explains it in detail, and there are special questions to be answered, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion places, and recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview process of looking for a job can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. As I said before, I don't know your situation, so I only introduce it in general and not in detail. If you have other people you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I, undertake all kinds (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall mounted furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, lampblack machine, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping service.
Thanks to those who silently give me praise, hard work for life life is very tired but to continue.
Life will not disappoint everyone who has worked hard, just pay attention to me if you like, and thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own process, in the face of life, we are strong, is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of heart.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will pay off!!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the good.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping has helped you to achieve the "net" I can, and serve love home.
Keep Wanjia clean, tree housekeeping monument, service in place, clean to home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it overflow its luster. The same is true of life.
We can succeed by doing it with our heart, and we are serious about creating exquisite beauty sewing with meticulous care.
Give me the opportunity, will make you satisfied, quality says everything, because the professional is trustworthy, your recognition is my most encouraged!!
All walks of life are not good at the moment!!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The plan of the day is in the morning, and all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and happiness, and keep a good mood all day.
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and when I had it, I was happy; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and when I reached it, I was happy; when I matured, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and when I understood it, I was happy.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a road, walk your own way; two treasures of life: Good health, good mood, beautiful and live forever!!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
2. Although the Rightists have a period of success in history, it is not long, so it is short because if you give a little sunshine, you will be bright, and if you drink a little boiled water, you will sweat.
But to be realistic, the Rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, and political groups will be mixed, and then foreign countries will take advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China's attitude of being patient and responsible for the country and the people, political speculators who try to make a chill in the fire, that is not the right, it is a bastard.
Talk about it again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this creation, because what the left wants is the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who were fighting against the thieves while refuting the left epilepsy, and they were still very angry.
Do not try to reason with the traitor and the left epilepsy. They are all a child, and there is no reason to talk.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not want to let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit, why?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left is scolding you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually away, and even the dragon slaughter youth eventually become a dragon.
I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China as a whole should be left-leaning due to the innate genes of history and culture.
In China, the right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and it is certain that the left will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's over if I like it.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so generous.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US Empire has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for "American" enterprises.
The US empire suppressed the Chinese chip industry and required its own companies and related companies from allied countries to block the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct result was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which led to a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip," technology giants in more and more countries have begun to "de-beautify" the road.
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and the United States have recently made frequent moves to host the "Chip Summit"; they have also invited giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant from the United States, has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and open up chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to rob TSMC of its "rice bowl."
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which will surely rise rapidly in the short term to defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, and he had no scruples about Intel's investment in building a fab. He said bluntly: Intel is building a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou is still resentful of a grudge between the front office and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the manufacturing industry in the United States, the peak of the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model makes some small businesses overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be prohibitive in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, in the 1980s, division of labor and cooperation began to appear in the chip industry. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, it was possible to set up a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has targeted its main business at the single link of "wafer processing" and does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a small minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obvious that it had a high self-esteem and despised TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect that the giant who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past, but now also want to start wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry.
Today, the market value of TSMC has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC is already sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Come and see some strange hot searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February 2, the rise of the dragon, the price increase of Holly Friends, and the goods pulling incident, the spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, and if there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They seem to be no different from the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] that was displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?!
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peaks], [jagged], [cliff].
[Lone Peak] is artificial heating, which quickly rushes to the hot search list and attracts public attention; [Jagged] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched on the hot search list; [Cliff] is a collective withdrawal, and the hot search has completed its "function" and received new tasks and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is the trough of another event, and the time is not different. It must be the unified batch of sailors who receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: Dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popularizing science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which coerce decision-making, and the black production accounts are conducted in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks will leave traces, such traces, we will dig them out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
As I understand it, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TVs, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for large-screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally 75 inches or more, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales in the world has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason why we have such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions than the backlight of LCD TVs, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the Beijing Union Hospital of Ophthalmology obtained 144 test data from a rigorous comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must be reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and they can achieve a large 100-inch screen experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies, such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video and audio players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has pros and cons.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector, a laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. You diffuse it to the ceiling, and the eyes can't see it.
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be an image at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: Shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before they can be established, and the approval of the CIRC must be obtained.
These three are actually very harsh, and to sum up, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the CBRC (which supervises insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and to have a good style of work by shareholders. As an insurance brokerage company, the insured need not question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, there are three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies sell their star serious illness insurance on this platform, such as the latest Hutai Super Mary No. 5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hutai Life Insurance, and Umbrella Insurance is only a third party intermediary, so don't question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment mode: The products of the Internet platform are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the salesman salaries, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of the insured to pay fees, and at the same time, they can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is very good.
You can consider.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health information and occupation, non-insurance employees often add their own subjective awareness when they insure, and feel that they are healthy or fit, so there are many hidden dangers in claims, and there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Weibo" (which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform, like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable, and the people who are not reliable are people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are many sales misinformation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance of 6 million yuan, buy insurance to send mobile phones, and receive 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid serious problems and will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is required according to the normal charge, ranging from dozens to 200, and many customers deduct fees for a year or two to buy their own is not clear.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world dropped the pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent by the special policy number such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it, and no one will remind you.
If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can you do? If you can't solve the problem, you will start to run naked in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misinformation of Internet insurance sales.
So, from a comprehensive point of view, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving each person 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on customer needs, shop around for customers during insurance, and try my best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After taking out insurance, I will do policy sorting for customers, and policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ceremonial" and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us for many years to come?
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, and then making ridiculous posts, to the time you tried to post my home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure, humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as appearance, body, good health, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, and so on.
How do I know that later I received a number of friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing remarks.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer be silent.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not rein in at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?!
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut off some of the messages to comment on.
No one should be able to impersonate you if you post your own post.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
Smile.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional report: Latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US naval arsenal is visiting Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, satellites spotted the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabac Strait.
The Barabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the U.S. aircraft carrier that is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C Carrier Squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the missile destroyer "Stockdale."
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend for a rare visit.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The rare visit to Guam by the three U.S. aircraft carriers to assemble the most powerful weapons around China is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrates the U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the United States mainland, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta, and the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money today has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, are all traffic channels for Meta, regardless of their functional positioning.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many apps host Meta ads, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow apps to access their information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be circumvented, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from the byte in the first two years.
All the agents in China are helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and Meta is also doing very well in Greater China.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at income, but also, more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told about the "meta-universe."
The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite the fact that Facebook is now very beautiful, with annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis, and compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is a blink of an eye.
But the unreachable concept of the meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and is constantly looking for new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a way of no return.
