First of all, in conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say that the film has no bright spots, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and the other that makes you indignant after watching it."Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented at insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, which is indescribable and has many holes like a trench coat on Brother Ma.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The man should live on an island in the south, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Old people ride vans from the south to the northeast to watch the snow?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man said nothing.
How did the hostess and his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small bikers on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why did a small gangster biker party who failed to collect credit and was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot fills the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, it is an abominable stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a plot film that wants to reflect that it is not easy for young people in a small town to survive. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit during the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational+comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie has achieved success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should honestly talk about the grudge between the young people in the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role of a new motorcycle that has just been burned and can still sing), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't bear to see it.
As for the hostess who is obviously not mentally retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Another thing I don't understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own movies?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish it, then the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry beat" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold it, and it is difficult for the master to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and I know you don't want to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. When that time, come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, and choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell the price. A new racket of 500 or 600 is very good. A second-hand racket of 200 yuan, is it not fragrant to have a thousand yuan racket?
It's very friendly to novices, but it's chicken ribs after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021 ?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic events that project managers can impact gold medals" is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and it is not a problem to put out fires, carry the pot and apologize.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management gradually choose to get rid of the difficulties in their work through some actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the China Project Management 20-year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP ® applicants in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP ® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and I don't know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project procrastination; The division of labor among members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to promote ...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises train a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "Chinese Enterprise R & D Management Talent training demonstration Base", came with the online course "R & D Project Manager Special training Camp".
The online course "Special training Camp for R & D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
You can first see what other students think of this course: this course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.
It is said that the exhaust sound of supercar in Xinshan District is the loudest !
This car brought by our team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's replacement-AventadorLP700-4 !
The asking price is nearly RM2 million, the road tax is RM10,000 a year, and the four-wheel drive is called LP700 ?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, the editor doesn't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds for 0-100 km/h to accelerate, which is probably when the editor's myvi reaches 30 km/h, people will reach 100 km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v 12 engine under the glass perfectly explain Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not be able to give!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (actually a little cool)
The fuel cost of 1 km is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, or it will be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the bus. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (what the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!
For more information about cars you don't know, it's in The CarGuide/People's Automobile Journal.
When it comes to a car accident worth tens of millions!
BugattiChiron and Porsche 911 believe that riders know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
At the time when NFT was rushing out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called AxieInfinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in the game.
"AxieInfinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of games including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction value, and has exceeded $3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that AxieInfinity has a daily revenue of more than $8.2 million, which is close to "Arena of Valor".
On August 6 this year, AxieInfinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "AxieInfinity" has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I see a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan. Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future, and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market size, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is "do the things right", that is, do things right.
The strategy lies in "dotherightthing", that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new ones; On the basis of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, which is the first time bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a housing agent. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the house owner, on the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "receipt of deposit for the sale of factory building", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agreed to sign the plant sales contract within one week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It was not easy to take a fancy to the house, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready, so I was "close to the door" to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not only be attributed to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract by double return of the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[lawyer reminder] the necessary duty of care should be performed in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of careful care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is your second week in Japan.
You walk down the street and suddenly find someone following you. You walk faster and faster in fear, and finally you run.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait! "(full Japanese conversation) You stopped in front of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. I think you are beautiful. Are you interested in participating in reality show? "
You are confused and afraid that this is a scam.
He gives you a business card and you find that he is really the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if we have time, we can go to the company to talk, and the pay must be indispensable."
You came to the company with him in a confused way. He said that he saw you in the street at a glance and hoped you could come.
You thought there was nothing to lose and you could make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale love reality show, which is divided into two parts.
In the early stage, stars and ordinary people will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.

The official recording will start next week. You don't know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
I came across the following article and talked about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help make canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between tin and bag so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the cans is just different!
Now let me tell you the reason why cans are expensive. Where is it expensive?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans instead of bags.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as the promotion personnel of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, unscrupulously linked with doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned bags is longer than that of bagged bags. If the shelf life of canned bags is the same as that of bagged bags after opening the bags, it is just that it is not easy to store and is easy to deteriorate due to moisture.
I just saw an article about my period. It's too long.
Give popular science to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, I will come regularly once a month on the premise of good health.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will overturn due to bad luck (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people spend three days and some people have a week; Some people flow less, some people collapse; Some people don't respond, some people feel pain until the ambulance is transported away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of the physiological period can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins.
If it is about to reach the cycle and have inexplicable diarrhea, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleep time, the worst case is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, tampons do not need to be changed frequently, they can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be emotionally unstable because of hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will stumble on itself.
But official crime figures show that women still have a high ability to control their emotions, and they don't use emotional problems as an excuse.
It's not just blood, it includes the exfoliated endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, all of them are removed (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built next month, over and over again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a few days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for her regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation of women's bodies for life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think so again. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude be embarrassing to face their mother and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They really work.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the way, and the metaphysical is called the weapon", which is translated by metaphysics for Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to "study which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the study of God without a word.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a subject of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging different moral values and giving moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to real life conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral subject (mL/agent), which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice, and it studies the ethics held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli et al., modern ethics (17 th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17 th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18 th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant and Hegel, 18 th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham and Sikiwick, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kier@@
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of the study of the essence and significance of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families and employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped us families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to our mother group, Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National Aesthetics Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often cross.

It is often difficult for relief money to be delivered smoothly to June 4 th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, the "Tiananmen Mother" set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphan elderly special poverty relief fund", which has been implemented ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by campus and social donations in June 4 th, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of June 4th finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4th that year.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped donating on June 4th for the consideration of donors. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect our decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and courageous colleagues who have been generous and risked delivering humanitarian aid money for many years.
A programming white who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose self-study, but you will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, the teachers of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the first learning cost is high, the second investment time is more, basically need centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources to go to bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that the study does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, and there are special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal recommended places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the later job interview can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only introduce it in general and in detail. If you have other things you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted boiler water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, installed lamps, glass cleaning, professional sewing, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently praise me, working hard for life, life is very tired, but I have to continue
Life will live up to everyone who works hard, pay attention to me if you like it, and thank those who silently praise me
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own support process, in the face of life, we are not only strong, is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back ...
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Cleaning Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and the effort will eventually pay off!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui housekeeping has helped you to "clean" what I can and serve my family.
Keep thousands of families clean, build a housekeeping monument, provide services in place, and get home clean.

Only by doing it with heart can we succeed, and we are serious about shaping delicacy with carefulness.
Give me a chance, it will definitely make you satisfied, the quality shows everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouraging!
At present, all walks of life are hard to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining! "
The plan of the day lies in the morning, and all the good things begin in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good luck, and keep a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and when I have it, I am happy; when I grow up, happiness is a goal, and when I achieve it, I am happy; when I mature, I find that happiness is originally a state of mind, and when I understand it, I am happy.

At every stage of life, we will encounter different problems.
In many cases, it is not your ability that binds you, but your courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Second, although the Rightists have had successful times in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink a little boiled water; if they have a little ambition, they will be able to look at Shu, and if they are hit, they will be attached.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied from the aspects of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I care about his remarks and respect Li Weidong very much, because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to take chestnuts from the fire by political speculation are not rightists, but assholes.
Let's talk about left again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left will not have this nature, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while fighting against the thieves, and they were really angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all the same tendons and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you for five cents, and when the left madness scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon slayer youth eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes from history and culture should lead China as a whole to the left.
The domestic rightists are free and pay attention to efficiency and development, while the leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and security.
At present, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will struggle to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll be finished if I like it
Don't say anything. Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists not only put Huawei in unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The US imperialism cracked down on China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in a reduction in R & D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries began to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions to host the "Chip Summit"; It also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocated funds to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so sure is that Intel, as an old technology giant of the United States, has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which is bound to rise rapidly in a short period of time and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, shrugged off Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking remark. Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's move to invest in building a fab: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960 s and 1970 s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, ranking at the top of the world and the overlord of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980 s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM mode, and the chip design, manufacturing and packaging and testing were completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980 s, the chip industry began to have the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing". It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it obviously thought highly of itself, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time would now start to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3 nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14 nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of the second dragon in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Lala incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[solitary peak] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search list, attracting public attention; [zigzag] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff] is collective evacuation, the hot search has played its "function", received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of water forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, and which entangle decision-making, and the black industry accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Aside from all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the theme should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV obviously focuses more on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, laser TV shipments and sales in the world have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why there are such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also less.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative experiments of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TV, the current price of laser TVs on the market is mostly more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
There is no false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself, and you are afraid to listen to one side of the story.
To put it simply, laser TV, an ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the curtain, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructure Fresnel curtains is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be changed into a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection as a selling point for their eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that your eyes can see is direct light to your eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. If you have to be serious, LCD TV is also diffuse "direct". Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot be imaged at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before it can be established, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three articles are actually very harsh. To sum up, we must have strength, approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), and shareholders should have a good style. As the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokerage companies, policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be achieved by any insurance company.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance. The claimant and underwriter are both Hetai Life Insurance. Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure by themselves. There will be many misunderstandings. In health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it, so it is easy to have many hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being refused compensation.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true and reliable. People are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example:1 yuan insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important points and will not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from dozens to 200. It is not clear what many customers bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world lost the pie).
Free mobile phone delivery is only delivered by the special policy number segment such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not exchange it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the policyholder) It is short-term to get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and your life will start to run naked in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform and the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself to underwrite offline products, and each person can save 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, who has 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from customer needs and tailor insurance products for customers. During the insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy arrangement and policy trusteeship for customers, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
From before to now, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just want to put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that we must resist first.
Since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting ironic posts, and then you tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to unscrupulously discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, I... Forget it.
How did I know that later I received comments from many friends about uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment on your Facebook friend account?
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what your status is, in our society, we need respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridicule, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some messages for everyone to comment on
No one can pretend to be you in your own post
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization
A knowing smile
Three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional reports: the latest news on Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was discovered by satellite near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean also has the USS AbrahamLincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USSRonaldReagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided missile destroyer "Stockdahl".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USSNevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
A rare visit to Guam by the three US aircraft carriers to gather the most powerful weapons around China said it was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980 s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomersubmarines".
The whereabouts of 14"Thunder submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually closely guarded.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make Thunder submarines "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located in the United States, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened before (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies that do offshore business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from bytes in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't learned about it recently, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "meta-universe".
Meta universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social software have relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is just a blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
