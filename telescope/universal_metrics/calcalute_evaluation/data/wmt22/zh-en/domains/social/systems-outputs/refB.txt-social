I’ll tell my conclusion first; Only Fools Rush In is a terrible film, in every sense.
But the film has one bright spot, i.e., the background music.
Terrible films can be divided into many types, including the films make you sleepy in the cinema and the films make you angry after seeing them; Only Fools Rush In is just like monkeys in Mount Emei, which can kindle your fury after you seeing the film.
Han Han is really a talent in insulting film viewers.
The most terrible thing of this film is that it is just like a creature of the Cthulhu school novels, which is nameless, filled with defects.
You may doubt if there is a metaphor implied by the director after you see it; however, you can find it totally a piece of shit after thinking over it.
I’ll introduce some plots that I cannot understand.
The leading actor lived together with his grandma in an island in south China.
His grandma had a wish of seeing snow, and an uncle of the neighbors drove her to see snow in northeast China with a minibus.
An elderly took a minibus to see snow from south China to northeast China? ?
And the leading actor and his father were at ease about it.
Then the whole film tells nothing more about the grandma.
In addition, running a restaurant in a wasted ship, how did the female leading role’s elder brother acquire the business license?
How could a punk on the island close a section of mountain road so easily? ?
A car delivering reinforcing steel bars was parking at roadside, but there was no truck driver anywhere around.
The sense of prop is so obvious.
How did a punk with poor credit record and suspicion of violation of law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn‘t the person call the police when facing with the usurious loan, and the police specially asked if there was a trouble?
An adult who knew how to use smart phone but did not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room card, who was arranged as staying overnight by sitting out of the room because of failure in finding the boss of the hotel?
The film is full of such inexplicable plots; the plots are too ridiculous that I even feel painful when I recall them every time.
In addition to the plots, the purport of the film is even worse; or we can say there is no purport in the film at all, and it is just a monster of stitches.
You may feel that this is a comedy at the beginning of the film; however, 20 minutes later, you may guess it a motivational film; when seeing a half of the film, you may feel it a story film that reflects difficult life of young people living in a town; you don’t know what you see after you finish it, followed by deep self-doubt that why do you see a piece of shit in a cinema during the Spring Festival.
Most people are familiar with the routine of various types of films; for example, if you want to film something about a motorbike, the motivative film + comedy can be adopted, to tell film viewers the way for a talented green hand to go to success.
If you want to film something about love, you just tell the resentment between a young man passionate in driving motorcycle and a waitress.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least there should be nothing contradict with things in the normal world in your plots.
(Such as the character who sang songs after his new motorcycle was just burned played by Yin Zheng); please don’t kindling a headcanon.
I don’t know if it is about the acting skill or the requirements from the director that the female leading actress behaved like a child of 5 years ago since she did not suffer from mental retardation.
There is another point that I cannot understand: why is Han Han keen on adding some plots about traffic collision in his films since he is a racing driver?
Is such a film arranged during the Spring Festival, so as to make film viewers unhappy and angry?
Thanks to the supporters today, and all the 80 boxes have been given to them!

I want to try tennis, and don’t know if you can insist on it, so I want to make practice with a cheap one.
In fact, price is often in direct proportion to friendliness; if you cannot distinguish, expensive ones are friendlier than cheap ones; in fact, the “beginner-level rackets” are industrial refuses.
They usually have low strength, leading to large vibrations when tennis balls hit on them; it is even difficult for masters to control it.
The logic and subtext for the existence is: tennis is really difficult, you will not be skilled in it, and you will not buy expensive ones, and you will give it up after playing to times; these ones are cheap, and you will not love them dearly.
When you can distinguish good ones from poor ones, you get progress; you will but expensive ones again, and I can sell two times of tennis rackets by earning two times of money.
I suggest you to buy a relatively better tennis racket of second hand with similar price, such as price or Dunlop; the two brands are not famous, with fair price, and you can spend 500 yuan or 600 yuan to buy a new one, or 200 yuan for a second-hand one, and you can enjoy the quality of a one-thousand tennis racket.
It’s friendly to beginners; however, it has little value after the beginner stage; however, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Games of the Tokyo Olympic, of course.
Do you think only Olympic players can win a prize?
An article named Look! Project Managers Can Go for the Olympic Champion was really popular some time ago; project managers can take the lead in many projects: moving bricks, business trip and staying up are ordinary things for project managers, not to mention fire-fighting, holding the bag and apologizing.
An article seemingly playful tells the bitterness of project managers, telling the ability not equal to his ambition to the current project management work.
People who work on project management select to get themselves from difficulties in work by selecting some actions.
According to increasingly grown number of application for PMP (international certified qualification for project management professionals), more and more project management personnel improve their project management ability through learning.
According to Development Report of Project Management of 20 Years in China (1999-2019), up until September, 2019, the accumulated PMP® registration number of the whole country is nearly 600 thousand person-times, and about 420 thousand of them passed the PMP® authentication, and the number of certificate holders is 300 thousand, standing for 31.2% of the total amount of PMP® certificate holders all over the whole world.
The number of PMP certificate holders during the latest 10 years has been increasingly grown year after year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is not sufficient to work according to “past experience”; the working environment changing quickly makes us realize that it is necessary for us to explore the road by standing on the shoulders of giants of science.
However, does PMP can make us do well in project management works?
According to many beginners of project management, the learning of the PMP/IPMP related courses can help them systematically master knowledge points such as ten fields and five process groups; however, they are confused when they are facing with real project management works.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: improper project management identification, depending on too much about personal experience or project management theories, knowing nothing about practice; lack of systematic project management process system, which cannot be implemented during work, failure in accurate estimation on projects, poor control sensitivity, repeated delay of projects; undefined labor division, knowing nothing about coping with the “old stick” in teams, unsmooth communication among different departments, difficulty in promoting projects......

It is known as the supercar of the largest exhaust noise in the new mountainous area!
This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men!
This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men!
With the high price of nearly 2 million Malaysian ringgit and yearly road tax of more than ten thousand Malaysian ringgit, it is a car of four-wheel drive; why is it called as LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast can it run?
Well, of course, I do not know it; according to related data, it takes only 2.9s for the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi is just accelerated to 30km/h, it is accelerated to 100km/h, hum.
The low car body, the arrogant scissor door, the huge air inlets distributed surrounding the car body and the 6.5 v12 engine which can be unobstructed under the glass perfectly explain the style of Lamborghini.
I don’t need to tell so much about the car model, and you can Google it by yourself; I’ve collected some explanations that may not be acquired from Google!
It attracts too much attention, which will make the car owner uneasy! (In fact, it’s cool)
The car owner just needs to pay 1 yuan for gasoline for each 1km (the car owner doesn’t car it at all).
The car owner needs to practice the gesture to get on and get off, or it will be a little awkward (because the car owner may not get out of the cab and will be blocked half).
There is too much noise in the engine, and the car owner may get deaf after getting off. (But it’s also cool).
Ordinary parking spot will be very narrow for the car due to the very large size, and it may be damaged when the door of the car parking next to it!
The car owner may be lonely, because there is no competitor on the road (it’s my idea, unrelated to the car owner, ha-ha)
Don’t misunderstand me, and the supercar in the video is not on sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to shoot a video for your car!
If you want to know more information about cars, please check it in The Car Guide / People’s Auto.
It involves in a car accident of ten million yuan!

A few days ago, an accident destroyed the million yuan sports car 911 and the ten million yuan supercar Chiron within a few of minutes!
According to the results, the high price is reasonable!
When NFT is emerging rapidly, there is a new concept in the encrypt community.
In 2021, a block chain game named Axie Infinity gave rise to great influences in the Southeast Asia region; some residents who lost work opportunity due to the epidemic started acquiring stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet raising game based on the block chain, which integrates multiple playing methods including NFT; as the NFT project with the highest trading volume, it has achieved the trading volume of 3 billion USD.
According to TokenTerminal data, the daily income of Axie Infinity can exceed 8.2 million USD, almost equal to Honor of Kings.

The popularity of Axie Infinity delivers a new “palytoearn” mode to more people; with the help of block chains and smart contracts, players are not single players; in addition to acquiring joys and economic benefits, they can participate in game ecology governance.
The subjectivity is not endowed by the game producer, but ensured by the block chain technology.
I’ve read a news about share price, and my largest feeling is that in order to choose the track, i.e., the selection of the investment target industry, firstly, enterprises have to select the industry with large growth space, with the market scale of at least 100 billion yuan; secondly, enterprises shall select the industry with favorable future growth property, and take the industry with the best state in the next 3 - 5 years; finally, enterprises shall select industry supported by policies.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, and the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness and the roughness refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer up for correct tracks!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the strategic layout of 2022.
The tactics is to “do the things right”.
The strategy is to “do the right thing”.
The strategy is utilized to find the direction, and the tactics is utilized to implement it; there is the space of strategic thinking on most tactical thinking.
For example, based on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think if we shall keep deepening in the current field or expand to horizontal fields (strategic thinking); for example, based on how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think how can we improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); based on how to improve activity participation (tactical thinking), we shall consider how to set correct activity KPI, to achieve correct activity target, such as improving objective customer participation, activating high-value silent customers and accurately attracting new customers; based on how to improve DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider if the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu understood a plant in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a property agency, and Mr. Lu decided to purchase the plant after looking at it for many times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a relative of the owner of the plant about the details of purchase, and made the payment of 200 thousand yuan through bank transfer on the same day as the deposit.
Lin signed the name on the Receipt of the Deposit of Plant Purchase as the receiver, and it noted, “If the buyer does not want to purchase the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the buyer in double, and both parties agreed to sign the Sales Contract of the Plant within 1 week. ”
However, both failed to reach agreement on main contract clauses such as plant ranges and mode of payment, and both parties did not sign on the sales contract.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
For this reason, Mr. Lu initiated legal proceedings to Yuyao People’s Court.
After hearing, the court decided that both parties did not sign on the official contract, and it should be reasonably presumed as failure in negotiation; for this reason, the case was not applicable to fine of deposit, and the defendant should not undertake the responsibility for breach of contract of repaying the deposit in double.
The plaintiff appealed after receiving the first instance judgment.
The court of second instance has upheld the original judgment recently.
[Reminding by lawyers] The obligation of necessary prudence shall be fulfilled during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer shall fulfill the obligation of necessary prudence; for example, verifying the information of the owner of the house, verifying if the house is occupied by others; in addition, the specific time and location for delivery shall be noted clearly in the contract, to avoid dispute arising from contract performance between both parties.
You are Zheng Mian, and this was the second week that you move to Japan.
You were walking in a street, and somebody was following you; you were so afraid that you walked more and more quickly, and finally, you even ran.
That man chased after you: “Miss! Please wait! ” (Japanese dialogue in Japanese) You stopped at the door of a convenience store.
“Miss...... I’m a film director, and you are so beautiful, are you interested in participating in a reality show? ”
You doubted if it was a fraud.
He delivered you a piece of business card, and you found he really a director of a large-scale entertainment company in Japan.
“If you have time, we can have a talk in our company, and you will be provided with considerable remuneration. ”
You were confused but followed him to the company, and he said that he liked you at the first glance, and wished that you could participate in the reality show.
Thinking that there was no loss but you can earn money, you signed on the contract.
That was a large-scale reality show about love affairs, and was divided into two parts.
In the earlier stage, celebrities and average people will get along with each other in real life, to cultivate tacit understanding.
In the later stage, they will play a game and work together to make breakthroughs.
The reality show will be recorded in the next week, and you don’t know your partner and what interesting things will happen.
I’ve read the following article by chance which discusses on why customers require logistics companies in the bonded area to provide canning services on the perspective of commerce and storage period, although canning is a kind of deep processing, not belonging to the operation scope of logistics companies; the article can explain why customers want them to do so.
I’ve contacted various production lines of milk powder in many manufacturers.
In fact, bagged milk powder and canned milk powder have the same raw materials, with totally no difference.
Then some people may ask: why the expiration date for bagged milk powder is one year, and that for canned milk powder is two years or even longer?
Or: what is the reason of such large difference in price between bagged milk powder and canned milk powder?
Many consumers or mothers of infants think there are differences in raw materials, and canned milk powder has much better quality.
In fact, the raw materials of the two types are totally the same; however, people think expensive products are better.
Because of this idea, some consumers even say that canned milk powder tastes better!
Then I’ll tell you the reason for the high price of canned milk powder.
What is the reason for such big difference in price since they have totally the same raw materials?
When pricing for products, most manufacturers consider that it is difficult for consumers to accept bagged products with high price, which means low profit or even no profit for manufacturers; then how do manufacturers to survive?
Therefore, they set a much higher price for canned products, so as to ensure their profit space.
For this reason, most manufacturers popularize canned products but not bagged ones.
In addition, the advertising expense for each year is generally dozens of million yuan or even hundreds of million yuan, then where do they get the money?
You can imagine.
With the development of the society, there are increasingly grown expenses in market promoting, such as the expenses for promoters in shopping malls, the expenses for display in shopping malls, the expenses for gifts of products and the expenses for advertisement.
Therefore, various manufacturers keep increasing new products, canned new products, with increasingly grown price; in fact, these are the new products released due to the increase in market expenses.
They are released to acquire higher profits; in fact, the increased cost in raw materials is no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Some other brands play hard in order to promote their products by cooperating with doctors in hospitals, who will be provided with commission of 30 – 80 yuan for each can.
Such operating methods are absolutely forbidden by Chinese laws; in fact, this practice is entrapping consumers.
Consumers are suggested to pour bagged milk powder into cans, to save expense; in this way, it increases the storage and sealing property of milk powder, with no influence on children.
In addition, in fact, the expiration date of canned milk powder is the same as that of bagged milk powder after unpacking; however, it is difficult for bagged milk powder to be stored, which is easier to be affected with damp, leading to moisture deterioration.
I’ve just read a very long article about girls’ menstruation.
I’ll popularize it to men.
Most girls experience the first menstruation during 13 – 15 years old, and amenorrhea will come at about 50 years old.
Then the menstruation comes regularly once every month in condition of good health.
However, it is not very accurate, and there is a tolerance of about one week, in need of preparation in advance; it may come several days earlier if girls have bad luck.
Time duration, blood volume and dysmenorrhea degree vary with each individual; some girls need three days and some others need one week; some girls have small amount of blood volume and some others have extremely large amount; some girls have no reaction at all, but it is so painful for others that they are taken to the hospital by an ambulance; dysmenorrhea changes with time, and some girls suffer from dysmenorrhea suddenly although they did not suffer from it at all.
Girls’ menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds 24h a day within those days; all what girls can do is to prevent blood from bleeding to clothes or chairs with menstrual pads or tampons.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused because of the secretion of the prostaglandin; oral taking of ibuprofen before the menstruation can solve the dysmenorrhea of the current month; however, nothing will work after the start of the menstruation.
Girls may have loose bowels before the menstruation due to metryperemia and too much release of prostaglandin.
If girls have loose bowels around the period, menstruation will come within two days.
It is suggested to change the menstrual pad every two or three hours, or it may breed germs; the menstrual pad shall be changed for at least 6 times a day if sleeping time is excluded, 7 days a month, and 42 pieces of menstrual pads are needed for each period; there may be 50 pieces when taking the ones for preparation in advance.
(I’ll make a correction, and it is not necessary to change the tampons, about every five or six hours, eight hours at most).
Girls may be irritable during the period due to hormone, and they may have instable emotions due to changes in hormone; in a word, it just like body makes them feel awkward.
However, according to crime rate disclosed by official data, girls have very high ability in emotion control, and they don’t seek excuses for emotional problems.
The articles bleeding out include both blood and the endometrium falling off.
The endometrium after the menstruation every month is the thinnest, and then it gradually gets thicker; it can be understood like this: the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium gets thicker) to welcome the guest, but the guest does not come, and the house is taken down totally (the menstruation is discharged), and a new house will be built the next month; it goes round and round.
Menstruation leads to inconvenience to girls; girls bleed 24h a day for several days a month in continuous dozens of years; who want to suffer it?
However, only girls with period can give birth to a baby, and menstruation; menstruation is coming in order to prepare for the house babies will live when they come to the world; people shall be grateful to the regular menstruation of their mother.
Women were often suppressed in the past, and some things were described as dirty and ashamed; however, times have changed.
If somebody feels menstruation disgusting, which is the behavior of women in order to give birth to a baby, they should not say it publicly; girls shall not have such an idea, and men who do not understand it shall not be ungrateful; how can they face their mothers and have their own babies with this attitude?
Girls can have a try of tampons, and they are really good.
Metaphysics means studying with rational reasoning and logic, but not acquiring answers directly from perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle for philosophy, which aims to explain the existence and the basic nature of the world.
The Chinese translated name of “metaphysics” was acquired from “metaphysics is known as idea, and physics is known as device” in the Book of Changes, Copulative, upper volume, which was translated from metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue, a Japanese man (the meji era).
Metaphysics includes some branches, i.e., the ontology, the natural theology and the extended issues.
The ontology is “to study which nouns represent for authentic entities and which nouns represent for only a concept”.
The metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God.
According to the theoretical basis, all the phenomena can be explained with the concept of natural reasons, proposed by scientists supporting science and the theory of evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method not to speak a single word about God.
Philosophy of mind is a brand of philosophy in research on consciousness and the nature of the relation between consciousness and the flesh (especially the brain).
The dualism and the monism are two main schools of ideas discussing on “relationship between soul and flesh”.
Theory of knowledge is a branch of philosophy in research on essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Moral philosophy is a subject in research on systematic thinking and research of moral life of people; here the morality is defined as all the standards of behaviors identified by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into the meta-ethics (which researches on theory of ethics in an abstract way) and the normative ethics (which evaluate on different moral values in a critical way, and gives suggestions on moral code for correct or incorrect behaviors.
It conducts research on what kind of moral behavior code shall be observed by people), the applied ethics (the science that applies the theory of ethics to practical living conditions, including biological ethics and political ethics, etc.) and descriptive ethics (which collects information about how do people live, and makes conclusion from the observed patterns.
Its viewing on ethics does not start from a preconceived theory, but a true decision made based on investigation on actual moral agent which can be observed; it promotes all the moral elements of the decision, and discusses on the ethics held by social groups).

Ding Zilin: to my friends.
I want to show my thanks to all the humanitarian aid provided by my friends within more than 30 years since our relatives died in the accident; especially, the aid has never been interrupted till now since I appealed to foreign friends in my name in 1994.
Parents of most victims have passed away, and their orphans have been grown up and have got married or got a job.
It was your magnanimous act that helped families like mine passed the toughest time.
At present, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading all over the whole world, and most donors will retire soon.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian donation to the mothers of the Tian An Men group, which should have been ended at an earlier time.
I will forever bear your love in mind, and will firmly believe that your magnanimous act will be remembered by the history.
I have to express my will due to some reasons, and please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Note from Tao Ye: Please allow me to introduce the history of the humanitarian act by IFCSS and MCDF for 32 years.
During the humanitarian act, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with intersection in executors of projects.

Sometimes, the aid fund could not be delivered to the relatives of the victims of the June 4 event.
In 1994, as suggested by Teacher Ding, a special group was established, in charge of receiving and distribution of the humanitarian donation.
In 1998, Children’s Education Fund for Orphans of June 4 was established by MCDF; after implementation of 11 years, when all the orphans graduated from schools in 2009, MCDF established the Relief Fund for Helpless Elderly and Poor Households, which has been implemented until now.
The funds of the projects were mainly from campus and social donations, as well as the MCDF.
Laogai Research Foundation has provided support from 2018.
Up until the last year, 31 years later, the relatives of the victims received part of the fund donated from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights was implementing its humanitarian aid independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding appealed to stop the donation because of thinking for the donors; we are actually retired elderly, with not as abundant salary as we did not retire; we are really thankful to the letter of “To my friends”.
We will respect the decisions of the relatives of the victims and will stop the project within 2 years, and will recover it immediately if it is necessary to do so.
I also want to show my thanks to the friends who helped others generously with money with risks.
A freshman in programming who would like to share personal experience
If you want to work in this industry, you can accept training in an institute; however, if you don’t intend to work on it, you’d better study independently; after all, you need to pay a lot of money for training; in addition, it spends you 6 months to do so.
However, if you intend to work on it, training is a really good choice, especially for those people with weak self-control ability.
People who have strong self-control ability can choose self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
Firstly, the most important thing is the teaching strength of the training institution; it’s meaningless for you to choose a training institution with weak teaching strength; of course, new training institutions usually do not have very strong teaching strength.
Secondly, you can ask something about the training institution before making selection; you’d better ask something from students of the training institution; after all, only students of the training institution can know it well and know the teaching quality.
Hello, in fact, I don’t know how to answer it, because you do not introduce your conditions; in addition, study is closely related to conditions of students.
For example, specialty, age, targeted language or even city are related to your study or your intended industry.
If you are a student in school or a graduate of computer major, and you have sufficient time, you can learn it by yourself, with favorable efficiency and the lowest cost; a lot of offline or online training institutions are good choices, but with high study cost and much time, and concentrated training of 3-6 months is required.
However, if you are of the condition that I mentioned before, self-study is the best choice; there are lots of free study resources in the Internet, or you can seek for training resources in b station; if you don’t know how to find the resources, you can contact me with the method in my introduction, to acquire free resources, or you can have detailed consultation to me.
In addition, some classical books can be utilized, in combination of videos.
If you are not a computer major and you can afford the training fee and the time cost, you can study in a training institution; in this way, you can study easily, for teachers there will give you detailed explanation and answer your questions; in addition, they can help a lot in study planning or supervision.
In addition, employment agreement will be signed by lots of training institutions, with internal recommendation quota, and you can be commended to work for a company; it helps really a lot in the interview of job search.
This is my opinions; I cannot have a detailed introduction because I don’t know a lot about your conditions; if you have any other question to ask, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I undertake various services such as (installing, cleaning, repairing) of wall-mounted furnace water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, closestools, cooking ranges, kitchen ventilators, as well as installing lamps, cleaning windows, beautifying processing of gaps, and housekeeping services.
Thank you for all the people who give a like to me; I will try my best to for a better life although it is really tiring.
Life will never let down anyone who works hard; please follow me, and thank you for all the people who give a like to me.
This is the life; others pay attention to only results, but I have to experience the process; we have no other choice but continuing the life, and we’ll never retrace our steps......
Cleaning is a job and is a responsibility; life changes beautiful due to services, and services are splendid due to thoughtfulness.
Although we did a dirty job, we will clean every corner of the home of our customers with the most serious attitude; when seeing the satisfied smile and the thumb-up from our customers, we feel really relieved, and what goes around comes around!

Just face with it calmly since you cannot avoid it.
If you are afraid of difficulties, you will be defeated by them; if you face difficulties, you will solve them.
2. Although the right wing achieved its ambition in the history, but it was not long; it was short because it was really arrogant.
To be realistic, the right wing played positive roles during the social progress process.
The positive roles played by the right wing should not be denied on aspects of defining the standard of truth after the Cultural Revolution, improving science and technology by developing economy and administrative systemation and guarantee of human rights.
3. As far as I’m concerned, although I disagree part of the sayings of Li Weidong, I lay emphasis on his sayings and respect him; because he is serious to China and the social problems in China.
However, I object to his anti-communist theory; I think the anti-communist theory will certainly lead to revolution, which will inevitably lead to social instability, resulting in damages to people and swooping by foreign countries.
4. Patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and for people are required to change or improve China; the people who intend to pull chestnut out of fire with political speculation attempt is not the right wing but the bastard.
Let’s talk about the left wing.
In fact, the left wing includes the abandoned persons of the era and the politics.
If it is said that the right wing plays positive roles to the society, and the Communist Party listens to the speech of the right wing and analyzes their thinking; therefore, the left wing is good for nothing, and what it wants is just those abandoned by the Communist Party!
5. Seeing that some people are blaming both mob rebels and the left wing, I don’t think it is necessary to do so.
Don’t try reasoning with traitors or the left wing, because there is no reason to talk with them.
Don’t try proving that we are correct, and don’t make the traitors or the left wing to admit it; we don’t need to do so.
I tell friends like this: When the traitors or the left wing blame us, it just proves that we choose the correct way!
Many people used to have ideals when they are young; however, they forget their ideal or pursue for ideal in a bigoted way after they grow old.
They go far from ideals; even more, and the people who fight against devil become the devil themselves.
The left wing and the right wing refer to restraint and freedom, and the inborn gene of the historic culture of China leads to a left trend.
The right wing in the country lays emphasis on freedom, efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision, fairness and safety.
The society wishes an environment of fairness; at the same time, the conflict between China and the U.S. determines a trend of the left wing; it is estimated to continue many years.
If you cannot understand it, just give a like.
Nothing more, and Huahua is so gallant.
In recent two years, the blocking and containing of the U.S. on Huawei chips not only making Huawei trapped into unprecedented difficulties but also making “American system” enterprises suffer from huge damages.
The U.S. applies suppression on the China chip industry, and requires their enterprises and related enterprises in its allies to block the chip industry in our country, leading to the direct consequence that the orders and benefits of all the suppliers of chip all over the whole world are influenced, resulting in reduction in research and development investment of chip manufacturers and in production capacity, which leads to shortage of the chip supply chain all over the whole world.
Today, “lack of chips” has been spread to all major industries all over the whole world; halt production of car enterprises and rise in price of mobile phones, almost all the industries in need of chips are greatly influenced.
In order to master the autonomous right in “chips”, scientific and technological giants from more and more countries have taken the path of “de-Americanized”.
In order to firmly control the control right of the semiconductor of the whole world and restrain the development of the semiconductor industry in China, the U.S. has taken lots of actions recently by hosting the “Summit for Chips”, inviting 64 giants to form the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and supporting American local scientific and technological giants by making investment; for example, in order to take back the dominant role in the chip field, Intel, an old brand of scientific and technological enterprise of the U.S., invested in 20 billion USD to construct 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, and provided the chip OEM service.
Most people consider that the action of Intel will lead to certain impact, and may grab the “job” of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
This is because that as an old brand of science and technology giant of the U.S., Intel has been engaged in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, with large amount of talent teams and technical reservations, and will inevitably rise within a short term, to defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, pays only beneath attention to the decision made by Intel.
Zhang Zhongmou spoke bluntly at the “2021Master Think Tank Forum” held in this April that: It is really ironical that Intel constructs an OEM factory of chips.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel to produce wafers is because that Zhang Zhongmou still takes the resentment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to Intel 30 years ago to heart.
During 1960s – 1970s, Intel was a pearl of the manufacturing industry of the U.S., ranking top all over the whole world, and was the powerful chief of the global semiconductor field.
Up until 1980s, the global high-end chips had been always mastered by a few of giants.
The IDM mode was the characteristics of the semiconductor industry at that time, and the production of chips including design, manufacturing and closed beta test were all completed by the same factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a mode made some small enterprises overwhelmed; many entrepreneurs of semiconductors had to flinch when facing with the huge expenses for construction of production lines.
The division of labor occurred from 1980s in the chip industry due to market demands; Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were some companies engaged in design of chips in 1984, and thought that he could establish a plant in producing of wafers.
Before long, Zhang Zhongmou realized his imagination, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was established.
By aiming at the single link of “processing of wafers”, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company did not design wafers but only provided OEM services of wafer manufacturing.
The newly established company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was only a small potato in front of Intel, the giant in the industry.
In order to acquire capital support, Zhang Zhongmou went to Intel to talk about matters related to investment; however, when hearing that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was engaged in the manufacturing link only, Intel looked down upon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and refused to make investment in it.
Zhang Zhongmou firmly believed that Intel looked down upon the wafer manufacturing services.
However, the giant who looked down upon wafer manufacturing in those days decides to work on OEM of wafers today.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is really ironic for Intel to work on OEM of wafers.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has exceeded that of Intel.
Facing with the powerful attack from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel does not dare to stand still and refuse to make progress.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has developed to the 3nm chips; however, Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is really difficult to catch up and surpass.
Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
What are normal public opinions?
We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.
We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.
What are abnormal public opinions?
We choose six top search topics of the same event randomly, showing the [isolated peak shape], the [sawtooth shape] and the [bluff shape].
The [isolated peak shape] is generated due to artificial heating, to give rise to attention from the public; the [sawtooth shape] is periodical heating, to ensure the topic ranks on the top ones; the [bluff shape] means collectively evacuating; i.e., the top search has finished its “function”, and new tasks have been received.
In Figure 9, the wave peak of an event is just the wave bottom of another event, with exact time; undoubtedly, the same group of online water army receives a new task and starts working.
We can see the professionality of anti-public relation: dozens of top search topics are ranking in the list at the same time; some attract attention, some are in charge of science popularization, some are picking fights, some are changing attention of the public, some are giving rise to influences on cognition, some are misleading judgment of the public, some are stirring up emotions, some are coercing in making decisions; the anti-public relation accounts attack with batches and nodes by taking almost all the factors in spreading of public opinions.
Spreading is a science; anti-public relation cannot hide depending on only objective data by putting all subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions aside.
There must be traces after walking; let’s dig them out.
Data source: top search Time Machine.
Is there any difference between laser television and traditional TV?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic owner shall be the liquid crystal display TV, and the differences between laser TV and liquid crystal display TV are listed as follows:
Firstly, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market.
When compared with the totally spread market positioning of liquid crystal display TV, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market; or we can see laser TV is the product generated for large-size screen monitors.
At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal display TV is between 55 – 65 inch, and that of laser TV is generally above 75 inch, or even more than 100 inch at most, fully meeting the demands of customers on large-size screen monitors.
In recent years, the global sales volume and the global sales proportion of laser TV have been increasingly grown, with the proportion of more than 60% in total sales of TV of or above 80 inch.
According to prediction by The Yee, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by 140% in 2020, continuing keeping a high speed increase.
The excellent performance in the large-size screen monitor market is mainly attributed to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the diffuse reflection image-forming principle of laser TV, the ray of light sent by laser light source does not directly shine into eyeballs; when compared with the ray of light of backlight of liquid crystal display TV, its image-forming process is close to that of articles in natural conditions, leading to smaller stimulation to eyes.
According to the strict comparative trial between watching laser TV and liquid crystal display TV by the same people groups in the same conditions conducted by Ceci Lab of China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, 144 groups of testing data have been acquired.
According to data: laser TV actually has strong eye protection property, which even plays improving role in specific aspects.
At present, vision health has been paid with more and more attention, laser TV has attracted more and more users due to the advantage in eye protection; in addition, it breaks through another field for the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TV lays more emphasis on high-end market.
Different from the increasingly lowered price of liquid crystal display TV, the price of most laser TVs is above 10 thousand yuan, which gradually increases with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why can laser TV be so expensive?
There must be some reasons.
With constant development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has lots of advantages when compared with liquid crystal display TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, when compared with the traditional projection equipment, laser TV has shorter projection distance, which can realize the 100 inch large-size screen experience within a short distance, in need of small space; in addition, the host occupies only a small space.
In view of brightness, the laser TV of a big brand can achieve the lumen of more than 2000.
In addition, with lower heating amount and less damage to equipment, it achieves longer service life.
Besides, multiple leading technologies such as the true 4K ultra high definition, AI system and bionic screen are equipped for the laser TV, providing users with more shocking audio and video experience.
In fact, it is the product of demand division; in terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio and video players; users can have a try about large-size screen and insufficient watching environment; however, the same knife cuts bread and fingers, and don’t trust all opinions of only one party.
Simply, in order to get closer to the curtain, the ultra-wide field short-focus projector – laser TV, has to use the ultra-wide field lens and the reflector with expensive price, which is not in accordance with the optimal design of optics.
In order to shield part of ambient light, the very expensive Fresnel curtain with microstructure is utilized, and the price of 80 inch is almost equal to a liquid crystal display TV of 65 inch.
In addition, I hate it very much when projection manufacturers take the diffuse reflection, which is propagated as being good for eyes, as the selling point; the ray of light on the curtain is the direct light for eyes, and the ray of light diffused to the ceiling cannot be seen by eyes; if you insist on it, liquid crystal display TV is also “diffuse reflection”, isn’t the ceiling lightened when you open the TV?
Besides, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, no image can be formed.
The heat spot (facula) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored; if large amounts of ray of light on a certain angle are reflected to eyes, it is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance on the platform of Small Umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an online platform of insurance brokers.
In terms of the setting conditions: According to the prompt in Regulation on Insurance Brokerage Institutions (modified version in 2015), insurance brokerage companies shall meet three key words: shareholder, no major illegal record during the latest 3 years of the launcher, minimum amount of 50 million yuan, and approval by China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, the three stipulations are rigorous, which can be summarized as being powerful, being approved by national authorities of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (the authority in charge of supervising all domestic insurance companies and banks), and good style of work of shareholders; as an insurance brokerage company, Small Umbrella Insurance is a regular company; after all, not all the insurance companies can achieve the 3 requirements.
Therefore, it is trustful.
In terms of the insurance products: The Small Umbrella Insurance is a supermarket of insurance products, and star products of many companies, i.e., the critical illness insurance, are sold on this platform; by taking the HTLIC Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance as an example, the compensation party and the insurer are both HTLIC, and Small Umbrella is just a third party intermediary agent, with no need to question its validity.
In terms of payment mode: Because of no operating expenses of sales networks and salary for salesmen, internet products generally have high cost performance, flexible payment method including monthly payment, which reduces the payment pressure of policy holders; at the same time, it can lift the lever to the maximum extent.
This is good.
It can be taken into consideration.
In terms of professionality of salesmen: This is the most important point; insurance is a industry with very strict requirement on professionality; however, customers can insure by themselves for many Internet products, leading to many wrong regions; with respect to health notification and occupation, non-insurance personnel often add their subjective awareness, and feel that they are healthy or they are in accordance with related stipulations, leading to many hazards in compensation, with risks of rejection.
I used to work as a staff of insurance telemarketing for “Wesure” (a platform of internet insurance brokers, just like Small Umbrella), and I can tell you in a responsible way.
Internet insurance is true and valid; however, some people say it not reliable because there is no professional practitioner for Internet sales channels, leading to many sales misleading.
By taking some marketing strategies as examples, 1 yuan for insured amount of 6 million yuan, a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan, there is no mistake for such marketing strategies, but the provisions may avoid the important and dwell on the trivial and do not tell policy holders that 1 yuan is for the first month only, the normal expense will be charged from the second month, from dozens yuan to 200 yuan; a lot of customers don’t know it even after fee deduction of one or two years.
They are misled to think they can acquire the compensation of 6 million yuan by spending only 1 yuan (fruit reaped without hard work).
With respect to a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, it refers to only special guarantee slip number such as 6666 or 8888; in addition, there is no prompt about it after the message of winning is sent.
The free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan (another trap for policy holders) is a short-term activity; without other commercial insurance, 60 thousand can do nothing in front of critical illness, which solves no problem at all.
Our country is cracking down misleading in Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, generally speaking, there is no problem in platforms or products; but there are problems about the professionality and the professional integrity of salesmen.
The owner of the topic is suggested to consider in a comprehensive and deliberate way, and many offline insurance brokerage companies have more varieties of products for customers to choose; some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I’ve helped 59 Internet customers insure with offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan/year for every one of them in insurance premium.
You are welcome to communicate and exchange with me if you have any question.
I, an agent of Mingya Insurance Brokers, have provided services to nearly 1 thousand enterprise users with the experience of enterprise management training of 3 years, and have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I customize insurance products for customers according to their demands; when insuring, I make comparisons among different products, to strive for the best underwriting results for customers; after insuring, I arrange and entrust guarantee slips for customers so that they can buy insurance with no worries.
Grow up together with each customer.
I wish that my answer can help others.
According to definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business that a policy holder can complete all the insuring process by himself after clicking the link of insuring.
During this process, neither the policy holder nor the insurance consultant needs to sign his name, and all the procedures can be completed by the policy holder only.
Although there is no “sense of ceremony” in insuring for Internet insurance, or even there is no printed paper contract, it leads to no influence on validity and force of law of the e-version contract.
This mode is just assembly line work such as “telemarketing”; however, it may lead to a critical problem; i.e., there may be unfavorable follow-up services.
Insurance is generally a long-term contract as long as dozens of years, and we need to consider if the “intermediary agent” we choose can provide us with services many years later?
I always object to slander and abuse of any form, and I cannot accept any personal abuse.
This is an inclusive civilized society, and we need to eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
Regardless of political party and school, the first one to be rejected is the uncivilized style.
Firstly, you sent the friend request on the Facebook, and then you published topics of scoffing, and then you tried publishing my home address and the name of my father on the social media, and I always adopted the attitude of no response.
Later, you were further intensified to tag me with the frequency of at least six times a day; even more, you discussed some vague and humiliating speeches about me with your friends on Facebook, such as the appearance, the stature, being good at giving birth to and bringing up children, and some messages about molesting, I... I also let it pass.
However, later, many of my friends sent your photo and your speeches about molesting on your Facebook.
Sorry, as a girl, I could not still keep silent.
However, after knowing that I called the police, you did not restrain yourself at all; instead, you were even more arrogant.
I don’t care about your political background or your identity or status, gender respect is required in our society.
Yes, you can continue your teasing, vague, humiliating and abusing speeches, and you can still tell that you just care about me or notice me, and you can think it not harassing, or you can even still deny that it is not your picture or you can still make all aggressive comments.
Ok, I cannot and I have no ability to prevent you from doing so.
I did not know you, and don’t want to know you in the future, and don’t find fault with my appearance and figure.
I don’t think any girl is willing to ask others to humiliate herself to make her famous.
My friends asked me if I was ok.
They didn’t believe me although I told them that I was ok.
I don’t think any girl would say she is ok after being bullied.
No matter in work, society, political circles or commercial circles, only those people who have even no basic morality will hurt a girl in this way.
I believe that justice naturally inhabits a man’s heart.
I have some screenshots about part of the comments for you to make judgment.
Nobody can pretend to be you since you posted it by yourself.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of the civilization.

(South China Sea Research Forum) It is claimed by united states navy in the statement that the visit of the Ohio Class nuclear submarine “USS Nevada” to Guam strengthens cooperation between the U.S. and the alliances within this area, and shows the potential, flexibility and combat readiness of the U.S., as well as the continuous commitment to safety and stability within the Indo-Pacific area.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called as “boomer submarines”.
The tracking of the 14 “boomer submarines” in the naval fleet of the U.S. is generally strictly confidential.
Around the secret of the ballistic missile submarines, “boomer submarines” become “the most important survival weapons in nuclear 3 in 1”; this system also includes the launching silo ballistic missiles situated in the U.S., as well as the bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
When talking about the crash of Meta by 26% and the market value evaporation of 25.1 billion USD, Zuckerberg replied 「facing with unprecedented competition」, then what is the reason for it?
Meta (the original Facebook) is an advertising company in the essence, with main income from advertisement; the advertising company earning money today has its own flow source.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., any functional localization is the flow source of Meta.
More than that, Meta is the largest”advertising alliance”, and many Apps cooperate with Meta in advertising, and change it into money through the Meta advertising platform.
However, time changes.
Firstly, it is very difficult for Meta to acquire the data information due to the adjustment in the privacy policy of Apple, which gives rise to influences on efficiency of advertisement putting.
The present privacy policy is friendly to users, and obvious prompt is provided about if the user allows the App to acquire his information, and most people choose no, of course.
Next, if Google gives an attack, it will lead to greater influences on the income of Meta.
Secondly, the Chinese factor is weakened in the income growth of Meta (there is actually the factor, although the specific ratio cannot be determined).
As we all know, Meta has no business in China; but, we don’t understand it accurately.
At least 10% of the income of Meta is from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in sea services.
The office of Meta in Hong Kong accommodates several hundreds of staffs, and it has several major agents in Chinese mainland.
In order to expand overseas markets, Meta is a necessary advertising channel for China, and most expenditure is contributed to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is one of the main competitors of Meta; however, Meta made a lot of money on TT several years ago.
Various agents in China are helping TT put advertisement to Meta, and Meta enjoys favorable performance in Greater China.
I’ve never researched on it lately, but I believe that it will never be better than before.
The stage that Chinese companies burned money in large scale overseas has been finished.
Thirdly, the progress in new flow channel expansion is not as good as expected.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms including TT are not mastered by Meta.
The biggest problem is not only drop in income but also lack of growth expectation.
The capital market settles on not only income but also future expectation.
Obviously, Meta does not have a favorable expectation.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells something about the “metaverse”.
Metaverse is actually one of the directions in the future; however, with a long realization period, this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta within the next two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years shall be a tough period for Meta.
Although Facebook is magnificent now, with yearly income of 100 billion to 200 billion USD, in fact, Facebook has very strong sense of crisis; it has no moat when compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.
Although all its social contact software have relatively high daily activity and are mainstream ones, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.; however, when facing with quick development of tiktok, Facebook is not confident enough, and it is a blinking of eye for tiktok to defeat it.
The concept of metaverse has no hope of success within a short period; therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, and this is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and keeps finding a new track; however, I don’t think he has chosen a correct track, but a road of no return; this is my idea for reference.
