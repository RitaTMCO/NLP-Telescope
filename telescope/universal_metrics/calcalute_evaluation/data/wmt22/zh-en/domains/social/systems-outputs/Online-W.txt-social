To start with the conclusion, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you have to say that the film is not a highlight, it is not at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and those that make you feel angry after watching them.
Han Han is really gifted at insulting his audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from a gram-novel, unnamable, with as many holes as a trench coat on a pony.
Even after watching it you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully you find it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I'd like to briefly mention some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The main character lives on an island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on him.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the plot is arranged in the neighborhood of a grandfather driving a minivan to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
A senior citizen riding in a van from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then this old man did not follow.
In the abandoned ship to open a hotel, the heroine his brother how to get a business license?
The island biker party punks why can easily do a section of the mountain road to close the road?
Then the middle of the road to send rebar trucks parked on the side of the road, surrounded by even truck drivers can not find.
This sense of prop is too obvious, right?
A credit can not and suspected of breaking the law of the punk flyers why will become an auxiliary police?
In the face of loan sharks why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there is a difficult situation?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use the room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranged to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep overnight?
Such inexplicable plots abound throughout the film, and because they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main idea of the movie, or rather the movie has no main idea at all, it's just an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film you think he wants to make a comedy, after 20 minutes or so you guess it might be an inspirational film, halfway through you think it might be a drama that wants to reflect the difficulties of small town youth survival, after watching it you have no idea what you actually watched, followed by a deep suspicion of yourself, why do you want to go to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people are actually very familiar with all kinds of film formula, such as you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step to success.
If you want to make a romance, then you can honestly talk about the feud between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not appear to be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng played the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can still sing), you can not go to open some even JFK looked at the brain hole can not be.
As for the female lead is obviously not retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing I don't understand, Han Han as a race car driver why he is so keen to add crash scenarios in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to add to the audience's frustration?
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

I wanted to try the tennis but was afraid I wouldn't be able to hold out, so I wanted to find a similar price to practice first .
Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive ones will normally be friendlier than the cheap ones, these "starter rackets" are actually industrial junk.
They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the top of the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't be topped, and it is very difficult for the expert to manage.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can not learn, also know that you do not want to buy expensive, make a cheap to fool you, you play twice, will not play again, so this racket is cheap, you do not feel pain.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you progress, then come back to me to buy the expensive, I earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket also can not sell on the price, new racket 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, have a thousand dollars racket enjoyment does not smell?
Quite friendly to newcomers, but once you get past the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not get past the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can get awards?
Some time ago there was an article "Look! Project managers can impact the gold medal Olympic project" article is very hot, which mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of project managers, fire fighting, pot, apologize is not in the conversation.
A seemingly joking and flirtatious article, but also speaks to the daily hardships of project managers, behind the representative of the current project management work is not able to.
The people engaged in project management work, but also gradually choose through some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma in the work.
From the rising number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) enrollment every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", by September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, with an effective number of about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP® holders has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the old "experience" to do things, and the rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, the PMP exam can guarantee the project management work unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP / IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but the real project management work is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, the work can not be landed, project estimates are not accurate, poor control degree sensitivity, the project is delayed again and again; members of the division of labor is not clear, the team of "old grease "Don't know how to cope with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ......
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtianhua Xia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key talents in R&D and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, comes with the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp .

What's more, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the learning into concrete work after the class.
No. The new mountain supercar exhaust sound maximum!
This time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement of the Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million RM, a year of road tax RM more than ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That forget I do not know, the data said 0-100km / h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably is the small myvi to 30km / h when people to 100km / h, well.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly illustrates the Lamborghini style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google it yourself, I have organized some Google may not give the explanation!
Too much attention, go where everyone is looking, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost in RM1 or so (owners do not care)
The posture of getting on and off the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because it will not be able to climb out of the cabin and then stuck half)
The sound of the engine is so loud that you will be deaf when you get off. (But still very cool)
The car is too big, parked in a normal parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked to the next car when opening the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor speaks for himself, has nothing to do with the owner, ha ha)
Do not misunderstand, this video of the supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Want to shoot video for your car friends, welcome to contact us!
More car information you didn't know about at The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
A car accident involving millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that car enthusiasts know each other, Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercar, and Porsche 911 car price is also a million grade!
That a few days ago, foreign countries in just a few minutes crashed a million sports car 911 and a million supercar Chiron!
Look at the results, expensive for a reason!
As NFT is flaming out of the ring, a new concept has emerged from the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game with blockchain technology as the underlying layer, which brings together a variety of gameplay methods including NFT, and is currently the most traded NFT project, with over $3 billion as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, which is directly comparable to "King's Quest".
On August 6 of this year, Axie Infinity officially said its daily users have exceeded 1 million.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, which means the choice of the underlying industry of investment, firstly, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best state of industry growth after the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics is to "do the things right", that is, to do things right.
And strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to implement, in most tactical thinking above, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve On top of improving campaign engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right campaign KPIs to achieve the right campaign goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and pulling in new customers accurately; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years in the making, Bitcoin is celebrating several milestone events in 2021.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agent to a plant located in the town of Yuyao zhangting, Zhejiang Province, after several site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Linmou after consultation, on the same day by bank transfer remittance of 200,000 yuan for the deposit.
Linmou in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signature, which contains, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit to the seller, such as the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign the plant sale contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sales, payment methods, resulting in the delay in the signing of the contract for the sale of housing.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is easy to look at the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, just "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, the seller is not sold, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court heard that the parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract, can not be attributed to the defendant alone, should be reasonably presumed to negotiate, so the case should not apply the deposit penalty, the defendant does not need to bear double the return of the deposit for breach of contract liability.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
Lawyer reminds】 In the transaction process to do the necessary prudent attention to the obligation.
When signing a contract, the buyer should exercise the necessary prudential care, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and to specify in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.

He slips you a business card and you find out that he really is a director for a major Japanese entertainment company.

You follow him to the company in a daze, and he says he saw you on the street at first glance and would very much like you to come and participate.
You think there is nothing to lose, but also can make money, so you signed a contract.
This is a big relationship reality show, divided into two parts.
The first phase will let the star and the vegetarian get along in real life and develop a tacit understanding.

I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and the preservation period of the perspective of why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help do canning, although canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and listened to are exactly the same, there is no difference between them.
Then people will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged milk powder one year, while the shelf life of the listened milk powder is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, from this point on many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but we think the expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset after eating the reaction also said listen to the taste or flavor is not the same!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reason for listening to the expensive, expensive where?
They are the same raw materials why the price difference is so big?
Because most of the manufacturers in the pricing time to consider if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that manufacturers generate very low profits, or no profit, then manufacturers rely on what to survive it?
So they have a large increase in the pricing of listening to the package to protect their profit margin.
So most manufacturers are mainly pushing the listened to, rather than bagged.
There are so many manufacturers you want to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, the cost of where?
We can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product giveaway costs, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So various manufacturers are also increasing the new products, and is listening to the suit, its price is also rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs out of the new products.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials to increase the cost of up to no more than 3, 4 yuan.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, by any means, linked with the hospital doctors, they assist in the promotion of the product, from a hear inside the profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And the relevant Chinese laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in cans at home on the premise that this will save money, while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on small children.
Also, you should not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of listening to the bag and the bag is the same after opening the bag, only that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, easy to moisture deterioration.
I just read an article about menstruation, it's too long.
For men who don't know about it.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
After that, they will come more regularly once a month, provided they are healthy.
However, it is not so regular that it can be precisely predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, which requires advance preparation, and sometimes bad luck can roll over (suddenly several days early).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person, some people have three days, some a week; some have little flow, some have a big bloodbath; some have little reaction, some have pain until the ambulance transports them away. Menstrual pain changes over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt for the rest of your life.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto your clothes and chair.
The main reason for menstrual cramps is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the physiological period before the menstrual cramps start can effectively relieve the pain of the month.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the physiological period because of the congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins.
If it is about time for your cycle and you somehow get diarrhea, you will basically get your period within two days.
Tampons are best changed once every two or three hours, otherwise they tend to breed bacteria. The worst case scenario is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that's 42 pieces, and if you add the prepared copies in advance there may be 50 pieces, not one for each month.
(here to amend, tampons do not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once can, up to eight hours)
The menstrual period hormones may be more cranky, ovulation will also be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, is very unlucky, the body to their own trip.
But the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and will not take emotional problems to make excuses.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, after slowly thicken, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day for several days a month, and abdominal pain and back pain, who wants it?
But a person can be born because his mother had menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come into the world, and everyone should be grateful that their mother had menstruation regularly and healthily.
A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought that's what it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the act of preparing the female body for the conception of life is disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking that way, men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this life and do not know much about it, do not be so ungrateful and do not know what is good for you, how can you face your own mother with this attitude and how can you want your own children?
Finally, the sisters try tampons, really good.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception by rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian aid you have given to our loved ones during the more than 30 years since they were killed, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has been uninterrupted so far.
Today, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become employed.
It is your kindness that has helped our bereaved families through the most difficult times.
Now that the New Guinea epidemic is raging around the world, most of our donors have reached retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop your humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers, our hard-luck family, as it is long past time to bring this humanitarian relief campaign to a perfect conclusion.
I will always remember your love and am convinced that your acts of kindness will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of IFCSS and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in engaging in humanitarian relief.
In their engagement in humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with program implementers often crossing over.

Relief money often does not reach the June 4 victims smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the Tiananmen Mothers set up a special group to coordinate and take care of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans had graduated from college, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphaned Elderly Special Needs Relief Fund, which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these programs, mainly from campus and community donations in the year of June 4, comes from generous donations from individuals and is supported by the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was only last year, after 31 years, that the victims of June 4 finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong collected in the name of June 4 back then.
During this time, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian aid program.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4 donation was made for the sake of the donors, and that we are indeed all retired elderly people who do not have as much income as we did before we retired, so we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends.
We will respect the decision of the families to discontinue this program within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
We would also like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have continued to give generously and risk their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

If it is intended to enter the industry is the choice to find a place to train, but if there is no idea in this regard, it is best to learn on their own good, after all, training to spend a lot of money, and also with 6 months of time to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, then training is really a very good choice, especially those who have weak self-control and training is a very good choice.
If your own self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn on your own, but will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
The first thing to look at this institution's faculty, if the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is not very meaningful, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who came out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution will know how this institution in the end, explain the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, you ask this question I do not know how to answer, because for your own situation did not do a certain introduction, and learning this thing and the individual's own situation has a lot to do with.
For example, your major, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and costly, now a lot of offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, the second investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, and now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b site also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile, get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some more classic books can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but also able to pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also people dedicated to answering questions, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion quota, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the back of the job search interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above is my opinion, because I do not understand your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me for communication.
I, undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-hung water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, hoods, installation of lamps, wipe glass, professional seam, housekeeping services
Thanks to those who silently give me praise, in order to live hard to struggle life is very tired but to continue
Life will not disappoint every person who works hard, like to follow me, thanks to those who silently give me praise
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own sole support process, the face of life, we are strong, in addition to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back ......
Cleaning is a job, but also a duty, life is beautiful because of the service, service is wonderful because of the heart.

We are serious about sewing, and we can only succeed if we do it with care.
Give me the opportunity to make sure you are satisfied, quality says it all, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my most encouraged!
All walks of life today are not good to do ah!
But I always believe that as long as the serious attitude, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting around complaining about it "!
The plan of the day is in the morning, all the beauty from the early morning Hope you carry happy, lucky, healthy, as you wish to start a new day, keep a good mood all day Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and I was happy when I understood it.
Do the most real and kindest self, according to the heart, no regrets in this life; life a road, go your own way; life two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful live to old age!
At each stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, what binds you is not the ability, but the courage to actively face.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by the difficulties; if you face the difficulties, the problems will be solved eventually.
Second, although the right wing in the history of the era of ambition, but not long, so short because a little sunshine will shine, drink some boiling water will sweat; a little ambition will be to get the long view, by the blow will be the hair will be attached.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social problems.
However, I am against his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups and mud, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, change or improve China should have patience and responsible attitude for the country and the people, political speculation in an attempt to take the chestnuts in the fire, that is not the right, is the bastard.
Talk about the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning to society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left does not have this creation, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently saw some friends dislike the anti-traitor while refuting the left epilepsy, but also quite dynamic, I think it is not necessary.
The traitor and the left epileptic do not try to reason, are a tendency, no reason to speak.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not try to make the traitor and the left epileptic admit, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you fifty cents, when the left epileptic calls you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they are old, they forget them, or pursue them, but they are reduced to paranoia.
And the ideal drifted away, and even dragon slaying teenagers eventually become the evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China from the history and culture of the innate genes leading to China as a whole should be left.
The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness as well as security.
Now society in general wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are fighting each other, the left is certain, it is estimated to continue for many years.
Although you can't understand it, click on it and you're done!
I don't want to say anything else, flowers are so righteous
In the past two years, the U.S. Empire's blockade and siege of Huawei chip, not only let Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also let the "U.S. system" enterprises suffered huge losses.
The U.S. empire suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, a direct consequence is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits have been affected, resulting in lower investment in research and development and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global shortage of disruptions in the chip supply chain.
Now the "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, cell phone prices, almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries of the technology giants began to move towards the "de-glorification" of the road.
In order to firmly control the global control of semiconductors, to control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old U.S. has been moving a lot recently, and is hosting the "chip summit"; and is inviting 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and pulling money to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, for example, the old U.S. empire technology giant Intel in order to recapture the dominant position in the chip field For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business to the public.
When most people thought that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why so sure, because Intel as the United States empire old technology giant, in the field of semiconductor deep decades, has a large number of talent team and technology reserves, will be able to quickly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was not impressed.
In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, for Intel to spend money to build fabs this move, Zhang Zhongmou no scruples to say: Intel build chip foundry, quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had been the pearl of the U.S. empire's manufacturing industry, majestically occupying the top position in the world, and was the world's hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been in the hands of a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only be deterred by the huge construction costs of production lines.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to see a division of labor and cooperation after entering the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were those specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Chang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC aimed its main business at "wafer processing" as a single segment, not designing but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC was a small minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, once Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that it had some high regard for itself and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on the wafer fabrication services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giant, who looked down on wafer manufacturing services, would now start doing foundry work.
So, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it's ironic that Intel entered foundry.
Now TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm 7 years ago.
Want to catch up in fact is not an easy task.
Today to see some [strange hot search].
What's a normal opinion?
Randomly pick three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Holliday's price hike, and Cargo Lala incident, the public opinion spreads to form a wave, then [the index drops] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and a small hump will appear again if secondary public opinion is generated.
They look similar to the [evolution model of online public opinion] once shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Six randomly selected hot searches in the same event show [solitary peak-like], [sawtooth-like], and [cliff-like].
The [lonely peak] is artificially heated, which quickly rushes to the top of the hot search list and attracts public attention; the [jagged tooth] is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic is coiled in the hot search list; the [cliff] is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has finished its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.

The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war to create momentum, which divert attention, which influence perception, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which hostage decision, black production accounts in batches, sub-nodes of refined combat, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, putting aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks by will leave traces, such traces, let's dig out together.

What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
To my understanding, the traditional TV the subject refers to should refer to the LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning differences, there are two main points.
First, the laser TV more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the LCD TV full-scale market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size more in 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest more than 100 inches, fully meet the user demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the laser TV in the global shipments and sales accounted for an increasing proportion of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above accounted for more than 60%.
According to the forecast of CEC, in 2020, laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high growth.
The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted from the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the backlight luminescence of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Sai Xi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch the laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed: laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye-care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV more focused on high-end market.
In contrast to LCD TV prices continue to dip, the current price of commercially available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrades, the price gradually climbing.
What makes laser TV sell so expensive?
There must be a reason.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, to achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is not large, and the host is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has its pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment can be, afraid to listen to one side of the story.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle near focus projector - laser TV, in order to close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflector, which does not meet the optical best design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains is costly, and the price of 80" can basically replace a 65" LCD.
One more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the curtain for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be serious LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", turn on the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, the projection curtain if not diffuse reflection, simply can not become like.
Just ignored the high gain curtain hot spot (light spot) effect, a certain angle a lot of light reflected to the eyes, that is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance with Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the set-up conditions: according to the "Insurance Brokerage Institutions Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)" tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, promoters in the last three years without major illegal records, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC.
These three is actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the CBIRC (regulation of insurance companies, banks within the country) of the state authority, shareholders should have good style, as an insurance brokerage company of the small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves of Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because less business network operating costs, and the cost of salesmen's wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and flexible payment methods, support for monthly payments, to reduce the pressure of the policyholder's payments, while you can maximize the leveraging of insurance.
This is still a very good point.
You can consider.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professionalism requirements of the industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this piece, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when taking out insurance, think they are healthy or in line, so there are easy to have a lot of claims hidden danger, there may be The risk of being denied compensation.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The Internet insurance is real and reliable, but what is not reliable is the people, the Internet channel does not have professional practitioners, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance to protect 6 million, buy insurance to send cell phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, will not tell the insured, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal charges, ranging from a few dozen to 200, many customers deducted a year or two of their own buy a what is not clear.
Think you can spend 1 dollar, the insurance company to pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
Free cell phones, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such special policy number to send, and if the winning SMS issued, they do not exchange, and no one reminded.
(This is another pit for the insured) free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, is a short-term, if only rely on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of a real serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future of life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is also no problem, there is a problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject consider carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than the Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, premium savings of $2000-3000/year each.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Ming Ya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, customized insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, try to get the best underwriting results for customers, after the insurance, for customers to do policy organization, policy trusteeship, so that customers can rest assured worry-free.
We will grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all the steps can be done by the policyholder independently.
Although the Internet insurance is not too "ritualistic", and may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract in any way.
This model, which is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", can also be a fatal problem in buying insurance, and that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, so when we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide services to us even after many years? Is it an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and provide us with services for many years?
From before to now, I am against any form of slander and abuse, not to mention the unacceptability of such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but it is this kind of villainy that must be eliminated.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to your flirtatious posts, to your attempts to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive stance.
You have since intensified your efforts not only to keep tagging me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some subtle, humiliating comments about me, my looks, my body, my fertility, and what to grow strawberries on the bed, and whether or not to penetrate, I... I didn't mind.
But then I received several messages from my friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and sexual harassment comments.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not stop at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political affiliation is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect for both genders.
Yes, you can continue the flirtatious, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to argue that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot and do not have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge me for my looks or my body.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me how I was doing.
You wouldn't believe me if I said yes.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic moral character would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the eye of the beholder.
I've cut off some of the messages for you to comment on
You should have no one to impersonate you in your own posting
All I can say is that you are a public enemy of civilization

The U.S. three aircraft carriers are assembling around China, and the most powerful weapons are making a rare visit to Guam.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait on Jan. 9.
The Strait of Barabac, which connects the South China Sea to the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vinson will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the carrier USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Fish Hawk carrier aircraft.
The U.S. carriers now cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on Jan. 3.
"The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried for the first time a squadron of F-35Cs, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdal.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam On Jan. 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @SouthSeaStrategicSituationalAwareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China, and the most powerful weapons are making a rare visit to Guam.
(Weibo @SouthSeaStrategic Situational Awareness) Another CNN report reported on Jan. 17 that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China in a rare visit to Guam, the most powerful weapon, a signal to allies and foes in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region, according to analysis.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China's Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
Pictured here is China's Yongxia Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness and ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 Boomer submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are generally kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding the ballistic missile submarines makes the Boomer submarine "the most important survivor weapon of the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I was talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and $251 billion market cap evaporation, and Zuckerberg's response that it is "facing unprecedented competition".
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, and they can realize cash through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the data information of users, which affects the efficiency of ad placement.
Apple's privacy policy is very user-friendly now, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the App to get their own information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow.
The next stab from Google will have an even greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the China factor, which used to be part of Meta's revenue growth, has been weakened (not sure how much, but it's there).
We all know that Meta has no business in China, but that's not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from companies that do business there.
Meta has an office in Hong Kong with about a few hundred people, and several major agents in China.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is the advertising channel they can't get around, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, TT of Byte is one of the main competitors of Meta now, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the first two years.
All the domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money in overseas is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline of revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at the revenue, but also at the future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about the "meta-universe".
Meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta-universe is rather long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now is very beautiful, also has 100 billion to 200 billion dollars of revenue every year, in fact Facebook now is very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although his several social software is now a relatively high daily activity, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but the face of tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye.
And engage in the meta-universe this unattainable concept, a short period of time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg and change the name of the company, and constantly looking for a new track of the fundamental reason, but I think his track selection is wrong, is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
