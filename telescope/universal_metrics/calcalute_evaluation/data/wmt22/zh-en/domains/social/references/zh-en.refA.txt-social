I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.
But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.
There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.
The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.
After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.
I’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.
The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.
His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.
An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus? ?
He and his father were okay with it.
And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?
How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
They are obviously props.
Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.
An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?
Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.
In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.
In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.
(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned ) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.
As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year-old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.
And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?
Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?
Thank you to all the supporters today; all 80 boxes have been given out!

I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn’t stick with it, so I thought I would just find one at a suitable price to practice with.
It was not friendly; in fact, the price is usually in proportional to the degree of friendliness; if you are not able to distinguish, then expensive ones usually are more friendly than cheaper ones, and the so called “entry-level” rackets are in fact industrial garbage.
They are low in strength, and there will be too much vibration when the ball hits on it; it cannot withstand hard balls, and even professional cannot handle it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, we know you can’t learn to play it, and we know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so we make a cheap one to fool you; you won't play it again after using it once or twice; since the racket is cheap, you don't feel it's a waste.
If you can tell the difference, it means you have made improvement; then you can come here to buy the expensive ones and I will make money twice.
I recommend you to spend the same amount of money on a better-quality second hand racket such as prince or DUNLOP; these two brands are not famous, and so even if they are good, they are not expensive; you can get a new one with 500 or 600 yuan and a second hand one with 200 yuan; isn’t it nice to have a thousand yuan racket with only so little money?
It’s friendly to newbies, but once you passed that stage, it will become not so useful; but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newbie stage.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all.
A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work.
People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the 20-year Development Report on China’s Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world.
In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members’ division of labor is not clear, there’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward...
Therefore, ZTCHINA, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D of management for more than ten years and helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of “China Enterprise R&D and Management Talents Training Demonstration Base”, presents the online course R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp.
The online course R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advancing journey of project management on your own.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises with less cost and investment.
That’s all my own introduction, and you may see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the ZTCHINA expert team (former Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods as well as rich template forms to help students transform and apply the content into specific work after class.
It is said to have the biggest exhaust noises of all supercars in Xinshan District!
The car that our team brings you now is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar and Murcielago’s next generation model, Aventador LP700-4!
It is priced nearly 2 million MYR and pays a road tax of around a dozen thousand each year; it is a four-wheel drive; why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower; can you image how fast that is?
Forget it, I don’t know, either; data says it takes only 2.9s to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi just reaches 30km/h, it is already at 100km/h, hum.
The low car body, extravagant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine transparent under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
The model doesn’t need much introduction; you can Google it yourself; I have prepared something Google won’t necessarily be able to provide!
It is too eye-catching; people look at it everywhere you go; it is uncomfortable! (It is actually sweet.)
Gas is around RM1 for 1km (the owner wouldn’t even care)
You need to practice the posture of when you get in and out of the car or it may be a little awkward (because you might get stuck halfway and crawl out).
The engine is so loud that you will turn deaf when you get out of the car. (But still, it’s sweet.)
The car body is too big; it will be narrow for it to park at a normal parking space; you will worry that the neighboring car might hit it while opening the door!
You may get lonely because there is no rivalry on the road (I made it up; it has nothing to do with the car owners, haha.)
Don’t get me wrong; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to take a video for your car!

A car crash involving tens of millions!
I believe car fans all know Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also over a million!
Recently, a car crashed into a million-level sports car 911 and a tens-of-millions level super car Chiron in just a few minutes in a foreign country!
It seems from the result that there’s a reason why it is so expensive!
As NFT went viral beyond its own circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has exerted a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet grooming game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT, and it is the NFT project with the highest trading volume now, exceeding US $3 billion so far.
Data of TokenTerminal shows that the daily income of Axie Infinity exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said their daily active users have surpassed one million.
The hotness of Axie Infinity has sent the new “palytoearn” pattern to more people; with the help of blockchain and intelligent contract, players are no longer a single character, and in addition to gaining pleasure and economic revenue from the game, they can also participate in the governance of game ecosystem.
The subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
I read a piece of news about one of my friends’ stock price, and my biggest feeling is the how the enterprise chooses its track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry; first of all, they should choose a industry with a large space for development and a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the scale of market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is easy or bumpy refers to the competitiveness landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first task is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The key of the tactics is “do the things right”.
The key of the strategy is “do the right thing”.
Strategy lies in finding direction and tactics lies in implementation; above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After coming into being 12 years ago, bitcoins ushered in several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small country, El Salvador, in Central America designated bitcoins as a legal tender, and this is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States approved the launch of bitcoin ETF by ProShares company for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology, bitcoin is not the leading role.
On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called Taproot, which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant located at Yuyao Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”
However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.
Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.
For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People’s Court.
After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from attorney] In the process of trading, we should perform necessary duty of prudence.
When signing the contract, the buyer should perform necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is the second week since you’ve moved to Japan.
You were walking on the street when suddenly you found someone following you; you got scared and you were walking faster and faster and at last running.
The one chased behind you, “miss!” Please wait! “(Japanese dialogue) You stopped in front of a convenience store.
“Miss... I am a director, and I saw that you’re good looking and so I want to ask you, are you interested in participating in a reality show? ”
You are confused and afraid this might be swindle.
He gave you a business card, and you found he’s really a director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
“If you have time, we can discuss it at our company, and the salary is definitely satisfactory. ”
You followed him to the company in a haze, and he told you he found you on the street at first glance and really wanted you to come.
You signed the contract since there would not be any loss and you could make money.
This is a large dating reality show which consists of two parts.
In the first part, celebrities and normal people date in real life to form unison between them.
In the later stage, they will play in the game together.
The official shooting is next week, and you don’t know who your partner will be and what interesting things might happen.
I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder.
Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same.
Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans?
Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better.
There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it!
Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.
Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same?
When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?
Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits.
As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones.
Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.
Everyone knows it.
With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs.
The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can.
China’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.
I just read an article about period, and it’s too long.
I’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.
Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.
Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.
But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.
You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.
(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.
However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?
But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, but only through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of Metaphysics originates from “the metaphysical is the Tao, and the physical is vessel” in the Book of Changes, Texts of Hexagrams, and was translated from metaphysic by Japanese Kajiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended questions.
Ontology is the “study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of keeping silence about God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between “mind and body”.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline which carries out systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the research where ethical theory is applied to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics), descriptive ethics (collect information about how people live, and summarize from the observed patterns.
Its examination on ethics does not originate from the expected theory, but it investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors leading to this decision; it studies the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part II: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant, Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham, Sikivik et al., 19th century, Britain National evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer, Huxley, et al., late 19th century, German Neo Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier et al., late 19th century, Neo Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional Ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche et al.).
Logic is a discipline which studies “the principles and standards of valid argument and proof”.
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline which studies the essence and significance of beauty.
Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.
Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.
It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.
At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Yean: please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are parallel organizations, and there are often intersections between the project executors.

The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.
In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the “June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund”, which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.
I am a programming newbie and I want to share my experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to get some training , but if you don’t want to, it’s better to study on your own; after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.
However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.
You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.
Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.
You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.
Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.
Hello, actually I’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.
Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.
If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.
However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.
Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.
The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.
I undertake all kinds of housekeeping services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, and professional sewing.
Thanks to everyone who liked my post; I will carry on working hard although life is difficult.
Life will not let hardworking people down; follow me if you like me; thank you to everyone who have liked my post.
This is life; others only see the result and you must go through it alone; in the face of life, we can only stay strong and carry on; there is no other choice; you can look back on life, but you cannot relive it...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is more beautiful with services, and services are wonderful because we work hard.
Although we do the most dirty work in cleaning, we will try to clean all the corners of the client’s house with our hard work; the moment I see the client’s smile and big thumb up, all the efforts spent are worthwhile; your hard work will pay off!
My daily work
- your requirements, my service.
Keep the beauty with attentive service and cleaning.
Feng Gui Housekeeping will try our best to care for the details you care about and love your house with our services.
Keep thousands of houses clean, establish a brand of housekeeping; standard service, in-house cleaning.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp looks luxurious, it will be dim if it has not cleaned for a long time; only after cleaning, can it shine brightly, and so is life.
Do it with heart and we can succeed; we are serious about creating exquisite things with our attention to details, and we are serious about cleaning seams.
Give me a chance and you will be satisfied; quality is everything, because professionalism is worth trusting; your recognition is the best encouragement to me!
At present, there is not one industry that is easy to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be slightly better than others; it’s at least better than sitting around and complaining!”
Morning is the most important time of the day; all the good things begin in the morning; I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and joy; keep a good mood all day long; good morning.
When we were children, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; when we grow up, happiness is a goal, and we will be happy when we reach it; after maturity, I found that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.
Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and leave no regrets in your life; life is a road, go your own way; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and you will live a beautiful life!
We will encounter different difficulties in different stages of life.
Often times, what is restraining you is not you ability but your courage to face it actively.
Since you cannot hide, you’d rather face it.
The more scared you are, the easier you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you take it head on, the problem will be solved.
2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.
But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.
4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.
Let’s talk about Leftists.
Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all.
Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable.
Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother?
I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid.
They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China’s history and culture make China overall relatively left.
The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
Just like it if you don’t understand.
No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
In the past two years, the blockade and interception of the US on Huawei chips not only made Huawei fall into an unprecedented difficult position but also made “American” enterprises suffer from huge losses.
The US suppresses China’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale.
Today, “lack of chips” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted.
To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips”, more and more countries’ tech giants are taking the path of “de-Americanized”.
In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business.
When most people think Intel’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job.
They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel’s move to build a wafer factory, “it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips”.
Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided.
The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry.
The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel.
Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is actually not difficulty to surpass it.
Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
What is normal public opinion?
Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.
They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.
Source of data: trending topics time machine.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.
Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers’ need for big screen TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.
The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection .
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.
Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.
As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.
Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.
Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.
With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.
In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80-inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65-inch LCD TV.
Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.
Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.
In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.
In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.
In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.
This is good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.
The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.
For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.
They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).
Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.
(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000-3000 yuan of premium per year.
If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.
Grow with each client for a lifetime.
Hopefully my answer will help the original post!
According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.
In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.
Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.
This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks.
In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies.
If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first.
I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media.
After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it.
It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments.
Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl.
After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant.
I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other.
Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you.
I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement.
I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this.
My friends asked me if I was okay.
You won’t believe it if I say yes.
I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this.
No matter it’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way.
I believe justice is in everyone’s heart.
I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement.
You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right?
I can only say you’re the enemy of civilization.

Three US aircraft carriers assemble around China; the most powerful weapons visit Guam in rare situation 2022-01-17 multidimensional Pro Communist media multidimensionally reports: latest news on China US Relation: the latest satellite image showed that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal in a rare case visited Guam, and sent an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to Chinese think-tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform”, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier from the US army near the Balabac Strait.
Connecting the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, the Balabac Strait is a strategic place on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that Carl Vinson will do deployment at the South China Sea.
This will be the first time that Carl Vinson carries F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft to do the deployment.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carriers cruising in the Pacific Ocean now also include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
Apart from the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently also deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser “Champlain Lake” and guided missile destroyer “Stockdale”.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo @SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) three US aircraft carriers assembled around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) According to report of CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal paid a visit to Guam in a rare case.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; according to analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China’s Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) the U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the US, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines”.
The whereabouts of the 14 “Boomer Submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes “Boomer Submarine" the “most important survival weapon in the Nuclear Trinity”; this system also includes launching silo ballistic missile located in the US, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”; why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.
Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta’s advertising platform.
But, the time has changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta’s revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it’s definitely not better than before.
The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.
The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.
Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.
In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe”.
Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.
Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.
