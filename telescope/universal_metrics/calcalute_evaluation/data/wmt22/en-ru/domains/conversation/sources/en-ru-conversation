My apologies again for the inconvenience this has caused you.
We are still looking ways to improve our services and this will be noted as a feedback to one of our valued customer.
I'm unable to make any changes once the order has been placed however, when the rider leaves the restaurant you will be able to contact them through the app.
You can also track your rider through the app and phone them once they’re nearby.
For future orders, you can add instructions for your rider by editing your saved addresses in the app.
You can also reset it from there.
However I recommend you resetting it from your computer, even if you are logged in on your computer, this is for you to remember your password, as this information is important to know by memory
Once your password is reset from your computer, please try accessing once again on our daughter's e-reader with your new password
please let me know if it works
I have checked here and it appears that the rider went there.
Have you check on your doorstep or reception area?
He might left it there.
Apologies for the inconvenience.
I can see here that there is no rider assigned yet to your order.
However I will note this on the records.
You can also use the app to call or chat them, once they are nearby the location you will have an option to contact the rider.
Thank you, please bear with me a moment whilst I look into this for you
I do apologise about this, as the account holder is not yourself we would need #NAME# to contact us to confirm her details, once she has done this and has confirmed she is happy for us to discuss the order with yourself we can then look at the previous correspondence for you.
Have a great day
Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.
