I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past.
If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs,
we might be able to help!
Depending on the company.
I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by.
I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately.
I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course.
Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!"
We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed.
Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services.
These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons.
It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps.
Some gyms let you rent lockers.
Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.
This is the thing people don't get.
The math doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy.
Maybe I'm a pessimist, but that's better than thinking you're invincible.
That shit will get you killed.
I think I took it seriously because I've been sick a lot, and I hate it.
I'm healthy in general, but the flu always hits me very hard.
I was scared that Covid was going to be worse.
It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough.
Still took months for my body to return to normal.
I don't know why it affects people differently, but for me it was body pain and headaches that were the worst part.
Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment).
Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold.
If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation.
It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.
This is a different issue.
Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop.
It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone.
Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be.
We treat the disabled like crap.
We treat the poor like crap.
Everyone in the US should be ashamed.
You're correct that our society needs to value human life more.
If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down.
We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths.
Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on.
Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS.
I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people.
It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.
In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups.
It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples.
Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact.
The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff.
However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident.
Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization.
Transparency is the name of the game.
Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country.
When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder.
Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.
I see it all the time in my line of work.
And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating.
Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life.
Peer to peer failed.
Insurance says it’s not medically necessary.
We appeal.
They say no again.
We go to third party appeal.
We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure.
We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure.
24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No.
Not medically necessary.”
My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE!
But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”.
Of course, they don’t.
And this kid is screwed.
No other option.
As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive.
We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal.
Not this time.
The system is so broken.
I told ya so....
The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was.
Needless to say, it was chaos.
At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was.
I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks?
straws?).
Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7."
Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there.
A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not.
He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8.
I'll help you find them, ma'am."
As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know".
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her."
HA....told you so!
PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system
I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories.
Not much to say here.
The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly.
I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them.
“Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.”
To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular.
I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on?
Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline?
“Sure, OP.
I am saving money to move.”
This is really rare.
My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever.
Where is she moving?
To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry.
I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer!
It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work.
So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city.
She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine.
Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.
Hey r/Military!
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.
However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.
If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?
If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.
Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.
I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well.
Sorry for my poor grammar.
English is my second language.
I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive.
When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!"
thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what.
I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover.
Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down?
They'd all have been killed.
BUT if they were like "Keep working!"
instead of "Take Shelter!",
that's different.
Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?
Amazing.
But good on you.
Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant.
Dishwasher.
First shift they had me close.
Saturday.
We were working till past 1am.
I quit the next day.
Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that.
Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot.
They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row.
He quit.
Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early.
> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.
This isn't even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
> Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.
Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?
It also makes for some terrible UX.
Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?
And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean?
> This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps.
That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.
Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size
Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage.
Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage.
I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.
I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case.
After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data.
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do.
I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable.
Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue.
Have you experienced this as well?
I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.
Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.
While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,
I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life.
To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward.
Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity.
That's the thing.
Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege.
Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist.
The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts.
But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.
We had power go out a couple of times.
Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately.
They are security now.
Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands).
Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there.
Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again.
Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 6: Return said cold/produce.
Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc.
Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out.
(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go).
It's really dark, even upfront.
No way can we let customers just hang out.
I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't.
Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay.
I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later.
One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on.
They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen.
I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could.
Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.
The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D
The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays.
On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.
I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?
It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility.
Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.
In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.
Couldn't they have done this on TNG?
We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.
The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?
Yep…we guys all have guns.
Even babies.
We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West.
I don’t even know where to begin here.
You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo?
A crack head is not a “professional mugger.”
If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what?
Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings.
Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening.
WTF does this have to do with race?
This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought.
I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither.
After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help.
Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want?
>This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi.
This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die.
No, it's not.
This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller.
If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit.
Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated.
>At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong.
We've already done this.
Twice.
It hasn't stopped them.
And it's not like this is harmless.
There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots.
Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match.
How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded?
How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know?
And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time?
I know plenty of people who wouldn't.
I was buying new tires.
I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.
I printed out the page and took it to my local shop.
It was part of a chain.
The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout.
Don’t know where he got the higher price from.
Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout.
He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price.
He was gracious about it too.
Been buying tires from them ever since.
You know something.
I get what Dave's point was.
It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people.
And of course that's true.
But Dave forgot something.
Many people who hate trans people also hate black people.
He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter.
He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric.
He's given credibility to transphobia.
And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence.
He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him.
How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.
I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words.
It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream.
Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating.
If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir.
Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive.
I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate).
Shipping alone was approx. US$100.
I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world.
Finally, love your boards!
Much respect.
Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned.
I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300.
But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not.
If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all.
It might just narrow your deficit that one day.
An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though?
That’s a no go.
If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place.
Maybe start with 300 deficit.
Hope this helps!
It was prior to 2018.
I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening.
The counter people were the worst I have ever seen.
A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here.
I had a confirmed reservation went.
After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off.
I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away.
I swore to never use Avis again.
Worst car experience ever.
National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me.
Those two, followed by Enterprise.
Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.
I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague.
It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.
Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this.
Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change.
I have been overweight/obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30.
The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.
damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.
Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.
Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.
Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days).
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.
When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention.
Like, little to no eye contact.
No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.
It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.
Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.
It is DAUNTING.
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.
Huge shock to me.
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go.
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.
An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.
When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause).
Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”.
I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car.
A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental.
None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).
None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department.
I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.
Android hardware Cleaning tip
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.
They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles.
I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions.
After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair.
After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood.
After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device.
And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.
There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.
Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work...
They work very VERY well!
After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new.
*I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.
A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee.
So to note, I didn’t witness this.
I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job.
These two guys came to the store.
One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law.
After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it.
This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door.
Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid.
When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him.
I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle.
I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on.
But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set.
He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.
Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course
I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course.
The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules.
The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.
If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.
Here is the course intro

How was the farewell to Etho was like?
First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife.
I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P)
Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right.
Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone.
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way >.<...
So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day.
Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc.
While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history.
Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial.
How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such.
Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things.
Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms.
This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me.
What I am after is the other side of the picture?
As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff.
So how was the response from 'the old gang'?
Did you keep doing stuff together?
Did you slowly drift apart?
Still chat or invite one another to events?
Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats.
Kinda the opposite.
I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt.
P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected.
That's awesome as heck!
Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help
I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders.
I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question.
I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc.
I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question.
He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping.
He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily.
I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone.
I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it.
He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away.
How was I supposed to have known he needed help?
He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite.
This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help.
He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.
Move the trailer!
Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop.
I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.
No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it.
The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something.
Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella.
The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly).
Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?
Me: No, the owner drove yesterday.
Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster!
Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it.
Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there.
You know we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?
Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah
Me: It was not me.
The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way.
From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.
Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2?
Specifically 2.10 "Over"
Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting.
Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this?
Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?"
A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time.
I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations.
I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday.
Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs.
Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time.
I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son.
He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person!
He clearly sucks at damage control.
Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.
The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.
My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates our back yards.
Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard.
I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.
but this dog is insane.
The maintenance guys are afraid of it.
So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.
I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.
Owner says no.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Owner says no.
(Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.)
Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan.
I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*.
Like, I saved and invested in this.
Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker.
There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked.
When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.
My speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.
The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.
Edit some grammar errors
Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL.
This can seriously harm and even kill an animal.
Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested.
It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit.
It sounds great for the money, though.
I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.
There's a circularity to it...
I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition.
The math they do is just crazy.
"We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness.
I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth.
Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper.
The problem is that we sold out the people below us.
I agree with you.
Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better.
Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...
