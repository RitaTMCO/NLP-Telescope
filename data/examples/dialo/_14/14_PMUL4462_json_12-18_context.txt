USER: Yes I do. I'd like to make sure I arrive at the restaurant by the booked time. Can you check?
SYSTEM: What time do you want to leave?
USER: Actually all you have to do is set the taxi so it arrives by the arrived time. Am I better off booking it myself?
SYSTEM: I have booked you a taxi for Friday to arrive at Old Schools at 10:45. Is there anything else I may help you with?
USER: I need the contact number and car type also.
